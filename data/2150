    Oh earth, oh dewy mother, breathe on us
      Something of all thy beauty and thy might,
      Us that are part of day, but most of night,
    Not strong like thee, but ever burdened thus
    With glooms and cares, things pale and dolorous
      Whose gladest moments are not wholly bright;
      Something of all thy freshness and thy light,
    Oh earth, oh mighty mother, breathe on us.

    Oh mother, who wast long before our day,
      And after us full many an age shalt be.
    Careworn and blind, we wander from thy way:
      Born of thy strength, yet weak and halt are we
    Grant us, oh mother, therefore, us who pray,
      Some little of thy light and majesty.
