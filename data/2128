    "Oh, lady sweet, I shall not long delay:
      This gift of thine shall bring me to thine eyes.
    Sure God will send on no unpardoned way
      The faithful soul, that at such bidding dies.
    When thou art gone, I cannot longer stay
      To brave this world with all its wrath and lies,
    Where hands of stone and tongues of dragon's breath
    Have bruised mine angel to her piteous death."
