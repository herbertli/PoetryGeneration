      Soft from the linden's bough,
    Unmoved against the tranquil afternoon,
      Eve's dove laments her now:
    "Ah, gone! long gone! shall not I find thee soon?"

      That yearning in his voice
    Told not to Paradise a sorrow's tale:
      As other birds rejoice
    He sang, a brother to the nightingale.

      By twilight on her breast
    He saw the flower sleep, the star awake;
      And calling her from rest,
    Made all the dawn melodious for her sake.

      And then the Tempter's breath,
    The sword of exile and the mortal chain--
      The heritage of death
    That gave her heart to dust, his own to pain ...

      In Eden desolate
    The seraph heard his lonely music swoon,
      As now, reiterate;
    "Ah gone! long gone! shall not I find thee soon?"

                                   _George Sterling_
