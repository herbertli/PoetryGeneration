  There are two Gods--one, Good, the other, Ill.
      They clash in Nature--so the Persian taught,
      And long a sect in Europe spread the thought.
  Why there is evil is a problem still
  To many, who see not in Human Will,
      A being that with beauty could have caught
      Up to his Maker, had he gladly wrought
  With light and warmth, instead of dark and chill.

  God said, "Let there be Light," and light was made.
      God made not darkness--that is light's exclusion,
      Forming a region where, in wild confusion,
  Men, Nations, each a ferret, blood-eyed shade,
  Worry each other, till, with disillusion
      For lamp, comes conscience, crying, "God Betrayed!"
