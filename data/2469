  Days of the future, prophetic days,--
    Silence engulfs the roar of war;
  Yet, through all coming years, repeat the praise
    Of those leal comrades brave, who come no more!
  And when our voices cease,
    Long, long renew the chant, the anthem proud,
  Which, echoing clear and loud
    Through templed aisles of peace,
  Like blended tumults of a joyous chime,
  Shall tell their valor to a later time.
  Shine on this field; and in the eyes of men
  Rekindle, if the need shall come again,
  That answering light that springs
  In beaconing splendor from the soul, and brings
  Promise of faith well kept and deed sublime!
