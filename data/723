A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD.

    "EIN' FESTE BURG IST UNSER GOTT."


  A mighty fortress is our God,
    A bulwark never failing;
  Our helper he amid the flood
    Of mortal ills prevailing.
  For still our ancient foe
  Doth seek to work us woe;
  His craft and power are great,
  And, armed with equal hate,
    On earth is not his equal.

  Did we in our own strength confide,
    Our striving would be losing;
  Were not the right man on our side,
    The man of God's own choosing.
  Dost ask who that may be?
  Christ Jesus, it is he,
  Lord Sabaoth his name,
  From age to age the same,
    And he must win the battle.

From the German of MARTIN LUTHER.
