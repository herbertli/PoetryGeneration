  This temple is soul-startling. 'Tis to me
      A thunder storm in stone, with Sinai flare
      Across the Ages. 'Tis the Fiend's despair
  And the Arch-angel's Triumph. It sets free
  The mind and soul with certitude, Christ's key
      Which, like the Sun, opes Heaven--the Good and Fair.
      Still, oft, what darkness drowns the sun's noon glare
  Within the Temple! 'Tis from Calvary.

  Oh, 'tis from Calvary's grief. 'Tis Christ's emotion,
      On from the Cross, that from His glory known,
      The German should have fled and, frantic, thrown
  Away his soul to Strauss or Kant's vague notion,
  Unhumaning, till, in the Kaiser, grown
      A Neitche whirl-wind in a crimson ocean.
