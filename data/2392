  Dead leaves and stricken boughs
  She heaped o'er the fallen form--
  Wolf nor hawk nor lawless storm
  Him from his rest should rouse;
  But first, with solemn vows,
  Took rifle, pouch, and horn,
  And the belt that he had worn.
  Then, onward pressing fast
  Through the forest rude and vast,
  Hunger-wasted, fever-parch'd,
  Many bitter days she marched
  With bleeding feet that spurned the flinty pain;
  One thought always throbbing through her brain:
  "They shall never say, 'He was afraid,'--
  They shall never cry, 'The coward stayed!'"
