THE WORLD.

    "And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
    righteousness, and of judgment."--JOHN xvi. 8.


  The world is wise, for the world is old;
  Five thousand years their tale have told;
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be,--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  The world is kind if we ask not too much;
  It is sweet to the taste, and smooth to the touch;
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be,--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  The world is strong, with an awful strength,
  And full of life in its breadth and length;
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be,--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  The world is so beautiful one may fear
  Its borrowed beauty might make it too dear,
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  The world is good in its own poor way,
  There is rest by night and high spirits by day;
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be,--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  The cross shines fair, and the church-bell rings,
  And the earth is peopled with holy things;
  Yet the world is not happy, as the world might be,--
  Why is it? why is it? Oh, answer me!

  What lackest thou, world? for God made thee of old;
  Why,--thy faith hath gone out, and thy love grown cold;
  Thou art not happy, as thou mightest be,
  For the want of Christ's simplicity.

  It is blood that thou lackest, thou poor old world!
  Who shall make thy love hot for thee, frozen old world?
  Thou art not happy, as thou mightest be,
  For the love of dear Jesus is little in thee.

  Poor world! if thou cravest a better day,
  Remember that Christ must have his own way;
  I mourn thou art not as thou mightest be,
  But the love of God would do all for thee.

FREDERICK WILLIAM FABER.
