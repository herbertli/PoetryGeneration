  "A dirty work," said Dyer, rebuked for spilling
      Hundreds of lives to irrigate new lands.
      A dirty work, but not for British hands,
  Dabbling in blood to earn each day their shilling.
  Hark! Mohawk Valley and Wyoming, chilling
      With thought of Tarleton's King-serving bands,
      And Canada red-clayed, though high snow stands,
  Cry: Work for which the British are too willing!

  Invaded lands need terror irrigation
      To make them fruitful. Better flood the field,
      Then let the native bloom become the yield;
  And, so, this Dyer submerged a small whole nation
  With crimson death, that England might, deep-keeled,
      Have for display, new seas of desolation.
