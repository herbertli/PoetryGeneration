  Are lust for Gold and Power not hideous spawn
      Of prehistoric reptiles, that had wings?
      Where e'er those crawled, they chawed all greening things
  And, when they mounted, how their lengths, full drawn,
  Basked barren in the sun before the dawn,
      Absorbing all its rays from budding Springs?
      These drain life's dawn and by impoverishings,
  Draw and reduce to pulp, frail Consciences.

  Oh, yea, bewinged with legislative crime,
      They bask in sunlight e'er the east sky greys,
      And drag the soul of man from God's embrace
  Of rights and freedom. Oh, how long a time
  Shall reptiles, deadly to the Human race,
      Be let grow wings and heavenward trail their slime?
