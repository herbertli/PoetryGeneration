    Young Nino and Leonora, they had met
      Once at a revel by some lover's chance,
    And they were young with hearts already set
      To tender thoughts, attun?to romance;
    Wherefore it seemed they never could forget
      That winning touch, that one bewildering glance:
    But found at last a shelter safe and sweet,
    Where trembling hearts and longing hands might meet.
