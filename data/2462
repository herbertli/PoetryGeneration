    A silent man whom, strangely, fate
  Made doubly silent ere he died,
  His speechless spirit rules us still;
  And that deep spell of influence mute,
  The majesty of dauntless will
  That wielded hosts and saved the State,
  Seems through the mist our spirits yet to thrill.
  His heart is with us! From the root
  Of toil and pain and brave endurance
  Has sprung at last the perfect fruit,
  The treasure of a rich assurance
  That men who nobly work and live
  A greater gift than life may give;
  Yielding a promise for all time,
  Which other men of newer date
  Surely redeem in deeds sublime.
  Forerunner of a valiant race,
  His voiceless spirit still reminds us
  Of ever-waiting, silent duty:
  The bond of faith wherewith he binds us
  Shall hold us ready hour by hour
  To serve the sacred, guiding power
  Whene'er it calls, where'er it finds us,
  With loyalty that, like a folded flower,
  Blooms at a touch in proud, full-circled beauty.
