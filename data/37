    O winds that pass uncomforted
      Through all the peacefulness of spring,
      And tell the trees your sorrowing,
    That they must moan till ye are fled!

    Think ye the Tyrian distance holds
      The crystal of unquestioned sleep?
      That those forgetful purples keep
    No veiled, contentious greens and golds?

    Half with communicated grief,
      Half that they are not free to pass
      With you across the flickering grass,
    Mourns each vibrating bough and leaf.

    And I, with soul disquieted,
      Shall find within the haunted spring
      No peace, till your strange sorrowing
    Is down the Tyrian distance fled.

                         _Clark Ashton Smith_
