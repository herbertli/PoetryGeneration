    "And all that noon and weary night she lay,
      Poor child, like death upon her prison stone,
    And none that came to her but crept away,
      Sickened at heart to see her lips so moan,
    Her eyes so dim within their sockets grey,
      Her tender cheeks so thin and ghastly grown;
    But when the next morn's light began to stir,
    She sent and prayed that I might be with her.
