  In the mountains of Mexico,
  Where the barren volcanoes throw
  Their fierce peaks high to the sky,
  With the strength of a tawny brute
  That sees heaven but to defy,
  And the soft, white hand of the snow
  Touches and makes them mute,--

  Firm in the clasp of the ground
  The opal is found.
  By the struggle of frost and fire
  Created, yet caught in a spell
  From which only human desire
  Can free it, what passion profound
  In its dim, sweet bosom may dwell!

  So was it with us, I think,
  Whose souls were formed on the brink
  Of a crater, where rain and flame
  Had mingled and crystallized.
  One venturous day Love came;
  Found us; and bound with a link
  Of gold the jewels he prized.

  The agonies old of the earth,
  Its plenitude and its dearth,
  The torrents of flame and of tears,
  All these in our souls were inborn.
  And we must endure through the years
  The glory and burden of birth
  That filled us with fire of the morn.

  Let the diamond lie in its mine;
  Let ruby and topaz shine;
  The beryl sleep, and the emerald keep
  Its sunned-leaf green! We know
  The joy of sufferings deep
  That blend with a love divine,
  And the hidden warmth of the snow!
