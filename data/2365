  O jay--
  Blue-jay!
  What are you trying to say?
  I remember, in the spring
  You pretended you could sing;
  But your voice is now still queerer,
  And as yet you've come no nearer
  To a song.
  In fact, to sum the matter,
  I never heard a flatter
  Failure than your doleful clatter.
  Don't you think it's wrong?
  It was sweet to hear your note,
  I'll not deny,
  When April set pale clouds afloat
  O'er the blue tides of sky,
  And 'mid the wind's triumphant drums
  You, in your white and azure coat,
  A herald proud, came forth to cry,
  "The royal summer comes!"

    But now that autumn's here,
  And the leaves curl up in sheer
  Disgust,
  And the cold rains fringe the pine,
  You really must
  Stop that supercilious whine---
  Or you'll be shot, by some mephitic
  Angry critic.

    You don't fulfill your early promise:
  You're not the smartest
  Kind of artist,
  Any more than poor Blind Tom is.
  Yet somehow, still,
  There's meaning in your screaming bill.
  What _are_ you trying to say?

    Sometimes your piping is delicious,
  And then again it's simply vicious;
  Though on the whole the varying jangle
  Weaves round me an entrancing tangle
  Of memories grave or joyous:
  Things to weep or laugh at;
  Love that lived at a hint, or
  Days so sweet, they'd cloy us;
  Nights I have spent with friends;--
  Glistening groves of winter,
  And the sound of vanished feet
  That walked by the ripening wheat;
  With other things.... Not the half that
  Your cry familiar blends
  Can I name, for it is mostly
  Very ghostly;--
  Such mixed-up things your voice recalls,
  With its peculiar quirks and falls.

    Possibly, then, your meaning, plain,
  Is that your harsh and broken strain
  Tallies best with a world of pain.

    Well, I'll admit
  There's merit in a voice that's truthful:
  Yours is not honey-sweet nor youthful,
  But querulously fit.
  And if we cannot sing, we'll say
  Something to the purpose, jay!
