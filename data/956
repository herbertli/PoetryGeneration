THE TWO WORLDS.


  Two worlds there are. To one our eyes we strain,
  Whose magic joys we shall not see again;
    Bright haze of morning veils its glimmering shore.
      Ah, truly breathed we there
      Intoxicating air--
    Glad were our hearts in that sweet realm of
        Nevermore.

  The lover there drank her delicious breath
  Whose love has yielded since to change or death;
    The mother kissed her child, whose days are o'er.
      Alas! too soon have fled
      The irreclaimable dead:
    We see them--visions strange--amid the
        Nevermore.

  The merrysome maiden used to sing--
  The brown, brown hair that once was wont to cling
    To temples long clay-cold: to the very core
      They strike our weary hearts,
      As some vexed memory starts
    From that long faded land--the realm of
        Nevermore.

  It is perpetual summer there. But here
  Sadly may we remember rivers clear,
    And harebells quivering on the meadow-floor.
      For brighter bells and bluer,
      For tenderer hearts and truer
    People that happy land--the realm of
        Nevermore.

  Upon the frontier of this shadowy land
  We pilgrims of eternal sorrow stand:
    What realm lies forward, with its happier store
      Of forests green and deep,
      Of valleys hushed in sleep,
    And lakes most peaceful? 'Tis the land of
        Evermore.

  Very far off its marble cities seem--
  Very far off--beyond our sensual dream--
    Its woods, unruffled by the wild wind's roar;
      Yet does the turbulent surge
      Howl on its very verge.
    One moment--and we breathe within the
        Evermore.

  They whom we loved and lost so long ago
  Dwell in those cities, far from mortal woe--
    Haunt those fresh woodlands, whence sweet carollings soar.
      Eternal peace have they;
      God wipes their tears away:
    They drink that river of life which flows from
        Evermore.

  Thither we hasten through these regions dim,
  But, lo, the wide wings of the Seraphim
    Shine in the sunset! On that joyous shore
      Our lightened hearts shall know
      The life of long ago:
    The sorrow-burdened past shall fade for
        Evermore.

MORTIMER COLLINS.
