  The sea goes up; the sky comes down.
  Oh, can you spy the ancient town,--
  The granite hills so green and gray,
  That rib the land behind the bay?
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
     Fair winds, boys: send her home!
               O ye ho!

  Three years? Is it so long that we
  Have lived upon the lonely sea?
  Oh, often I thought we'd see the town,
  When the sea went up, and the sky came down.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  Even the winter winds would rouse
  A memory of my father's house;
  For round his windows and his door
  They made the same deep, mouthless roar.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  And when the summer's breezes beat,
  Methought I saw the sunny street
  Where stood my Kate. Beneath her hand
  She gazed far out, far out from land.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  Farthest away, I oftenest dreamed
  That I was with her. Then it seemed
  A single stride the ocean wide
  Had bridged, and brought me to her side.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  But though so near we're drawing, now,
  'T is farther off--I know not how.
  We sail and sail: we see no home.
  Would that we into port were come!
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  At night, the same stars o'er the mast:
  The mast sways round--however fast
  We fly--still sways and swings around
  One scanty circle's starry bound.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  Ah, many a month those stars have shone,
  And many a golden morn has flown,
  Since that so solemn, happy morn,
  When, I away, my babe was born.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  And, though so near we're drawing, now,
  'T is farther off--I know not how:--
  I would not aught amiss had come
  To babe or mother there, at home!
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  'T is but a seeming: swiftly rush
  The seas, beneath. I hear the crush
  Of foamy ridges 'gainst the prow.
  Longing outspeeds the breeze, I know.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!

  Patience, my mates! Though not this eve
  We cast our anchor, yet believe,
  If but the wind holds, short the run:
  We'll sail in with to-morrow's sun.
     O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
     Fair winds, boys: send her home!
          O ye ho!
