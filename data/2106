    Poor Nino listens with that marble face,
      And eyes that move not, strangely wide and set.
    The monk continues with his mournful grace:
      "She told me, Nino, how you often met
    In secret, and your plighted loves kept pace
      Together, tangled in the self-same net;
    Your dream's dark danger and its dread you knew,
    And still you met, and still your passion grew.
