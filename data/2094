    Ah, sweet their dreams, and sweet the life they led
      With that great love that was their bosoms' all,
    Yet ever shadowed by some circling dread
      It gloomed at moments deep and tragical,
    And so for many a month they seemed to tread
      With fluttering hearts, whatever might befall,
    Half glad, half sad, their sweet and secret way
    To the soft tune of some old lover's lay.
