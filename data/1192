REQUIEM

FOR ONE SLAIN IN BATTLE.


  Breathe, trumpets, breathe
    Slow notes of saddest wailing,--
  Sadly responsive peal, ye muffled drums;
  Comrades, with downcast eyes
      And banners trailing,
      Attend him home,--
  The youthful warrior comes.

  Upon his shield,
    Upon his shield returning,
  Borne from the field of honor
    Where he fell;
  Glory and grief, together clasped
    In mourning,
  His fame, his fate
    With sobs exulting tell.

  Wrap round his breast
    The flag his breast defended,--
  His country's flag,
    In battle's front unrolled:
  For it he died;
    On earth forever ended
  His brave young life
    Lives in each sacred fold.
  With proud fond tears,
    By tinge of shame untainted,
  Bear him, and lay him
    Gently in his grave:

  Above the hero write,--
    The young, half-sainted,--
  His country asked his life,
    His life he gave!

GEORGE LUNT.
