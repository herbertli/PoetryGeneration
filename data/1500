  "The Angels come in dreams," says Holy Writ;
      And Science says, "No sleep so deep, but dreams."
      Devine appearances with brightening gleams
  Toward Paradise up from the demon's pit,
  Ever rouse virtue; aye, for God redeems
      His fire, wherever hid; the tempest teems,
      But still his sparks fly, quick as flint is hit.

  Wake, Canada! and let thy Papineaus
      Be dreams remembered; yea, let them inspire
      Thy life to follow Freedom high and higher
  Through Rights' whole range of summits, crowned with snows
  Sparkling from star-moulds of the Soul's desire,
      On earth from Heaven where, clouds from flames, they rose.
