  Wake, Caledonia! though Macauley, Whigging,
      Would ward the flames from scarring William's face,
      So that, then, Cain might shriek,--here, take my place,
  A fugitive and outcast, with no digging
  To hide in, nor a rest for my fatiguing;
      The mark on me, is but God's finger trace;
      On you, 'tis God's whole hand!--Still, there's the blaze!
  There's England's soul of merciless intriguing!

  List! 'tis the bagpipes welcoming the guest.
      See the assembly, dance and feast. Oh, watch
      The open heart and flow of good old Scotch;
  The English come, as friends, must have the best.
  There, hospitality is at top notch,--
      And so is treachery in Britain's breast.
