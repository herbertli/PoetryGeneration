IF WE HAD BUT A DAY.


  We should fill the hours with the sweetest things,
    If we had but a day;
  We should drink alone at the purest springs
    In our upward way;
  We should love with a lifetime's love in an hour,
    If the hours were few;
  We should rest, not for dreams, but for fresher power
    To be and to do.

  We should guide our wayward or wearied wills
    By the clearest light;
  We should keep our eyes on the heavenly hills,
    If they lay in sight;
  We should trample the pride and the discontent
    Beneath our feet;
  We should take whatever a good God sent,
    With a trust complete.

  We should waste no moments in weak regret,
    If the day were but one;
  If what we remember and what we forget
    Went out with the sun;
  We should be from our clamorous selves set free,
    To work or to pray,
  And to be what the Father would have us be.
    If we had but a day.

MARY LOWE DICKINSON.
