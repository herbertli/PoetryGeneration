  The monster's inhalations empty Hell
      Of all deterents to Life's flow and flower;
      Then, its outbreathings icily devour
  The cataract in flight and, down the dell,
  The streamlets to delight, and buds, as well,
      Of virtue, forming bloom for Freedom's bower;--
      Nay, its out breathings,--through Creed hatred's power--
  Grow Boreus and face where freeman dwell.

  Lo! with Sun-warmth for Truth and Human Right,
      Is Boreus met. Who hurles him down the deep?
      Look close;--'tis Gladden who, on Freedom's steep,
  Is as inspiring, as, on Andes' height,
  The great Christ Statue, bidding Rancor sleep
      And Life's diverging rays in love, beam Light.
