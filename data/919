I SAW THEE.

    "When thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee."


  I Saw thee when, as twilight fell,
    And evening lit her fairest star,
  Thy footsteps sought yon quiet dell,
    The world's confusion left afar.

  I saw thee when thou stood'st alone,
    Where drooping branches thick o'erhung,
  Thy still retreat to all unknown,
    Hid in deep shadows darkly flung.

  I saw thee when, as died each sound
    Of bleating flock or woodland bird,
  Kneeling, as if on holy ground,
    Thy voice the listening silence heard.

  I saw thy calm, uplifted eyes,
    And marked the heaving of thy breast,
  When rose to heaven thy heartfelt sighs
    For purer life, for perfect rest.

  I saw the light that o'er thy face
    Stole with a soft, suffusing glow,
  As if, within, celestial grace
    Breathed the same bliss that angels know.

  I saw--what thou didst not--above
    Thy lowly head an open heaven;
  And tokens of thy Father's love
    With smiles to thy rapt spirit given.

  I saw thee from that sacred spot
    With firm and peaceful soul depart;
  I, Jesus, saw thee,--doubt it not,--
    And read the secrets of thy heart!

RAY PALMER.
