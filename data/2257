 Where swallows and wheatfields are,
   O hamlet brown and still,
 O river that shineth far,
   By meadow, pier, and mill:

 O endless sunsteeped plain,
   With forests in dim blue shrouds,
 And little wisps of rain,
   Falling from far-off clouds:

 I come from the choking air
   Of passion, doubt, and strife,
 With a spirit and mind laid bare
   To your healing breadth of life:

 O fruitful and sacred ground,
   O sunlight and summer sky,
 Absorb me and fold me round,
   For broken and tired am I.
