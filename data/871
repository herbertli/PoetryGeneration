THE THREE ENEMIES.


  THE FLESH.

  "Sweet, thou art pale."
                  "More pale to see,
  Christ hung upon the cruel tree
  And bore his Father's wrath for me."

  "Sweet, thou art sad."
                  "Beneath a rod
  More heavy Christ for my sake trod
  The wine-press of the wrath of God."

  "Sweet, thou art weary."
                  "Not so Christ:
  Whose mighty love of me sufficed
  For strength, salvation, eucharist."

  "Sweet, thou art footsore."
                  "If I bleed,
  His feet have bled: yea, in my need
  His heart once bled for mine indeed."


  THE WORLD.

  "Sweet, thou art young."
                  "So he was young
  Who for my sake in silence hung
  Upon the cross with passion wrung."

  "Look, thou art fair."
                  "He was more fair
  Than men, who deigned for me to wear
  A visage marred beyond compare."

  "And thou hast riches."
                  "Daily bread:
  All else is his; who living, dead,
  For me lacked where to lay his head."

  "And life is sweet."
                  "It was not so
  To him, whose cup did overflow
  With mine unutterable woe."


  THE DEVIL.

  "Thou drinkest deep."
                  "When Christ would sup
  He drained the dregs from out my cup;
  So how should I be lifted up?"

  "Thou shalt win glory."
                  "In the skies,
  Lord Jesus, cover up mine eyes.
  Lest they should look on vanities."

  "Thou shalt have knowledge."
                  "Helpless dust,
  In thee, O Lord, I put my trust:
  Answer thou for me, Wise and Just."
