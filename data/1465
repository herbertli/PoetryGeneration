  Speak Freedom! When a haggard fugitive,
      Thy dwelling was a swamp, who first to trace
      Thy crimson footprints to thy hiding place?
  With signs thou hadst not many days to live,
  I found thee. Had the sun more heart to give
      To warm thee, than I gave? Ah, then and there
      Thy heart said to my heart; "Ill would I fare
  Without thee. I give love for love, believe".

  Thy silence, when in glory, troubles me.
      Oh! warm blood dashed back cold, chills to the bone!
      What do I ask for? Only Erin's own,
  That which God gave her, and, if true it be,
  Thou art the minister of justice grown,
      Thy gratitude should thunder God's decree.
