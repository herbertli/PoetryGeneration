The sun is clear of bird and cloud,
  The grass shines windless, grey and still,
In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,
  The cuckoo echoes on the hill;
Yet soft along Alulvan's walks
    The ghost at noonday stalks.

His eyes in shadow of his hat
  Stare on the ruins of his house;
His cloak, up-fastened with a brooch,
  Of faded velvet grey as mouse,
Brushes the roses as he goes:
    Yet wavers not one rose.

The wild birds in a cloud fly up
  From their sweet feeding in the fruit;
The droning of the bees and flies
  Rises gradual as a lute;
Is it for fear the birds are flown,
    And shrills the insect-drone?

Thick is the ivy over Alulvan,
  And crisp with summer-heat its turf;
Far, far across its empty pastures
  Alulvan's sands are white with surf:
And he himself is grey as the sea,
    Watching beneath an elder-tree.

All night the fretful, shrill Banshee
  Lurks in the ivy's dark festoons,
Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,
  Through magpie changing of the moons:
"Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,
  The doom of lone Alulvan!"
