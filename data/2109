    "The end came soon; 'twas never known to thee;
      But, when your love was scarce a six months old,
    She sat one day beside her father's knee,
      And in her ears the dreadful thing was told.
    Within one month her bridal hour should be
      With Messer Gianni for his power and gold;
    And as she sat with whitened lips the while,
    The old man kissed her, with his crafty smile.
