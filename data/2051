    Breathers of wisdom won without a quest,
      Quaint uncouth dreamers, voices high and strange,
      Flutists of lands where beauty hath no change,
    And wintery grief is a forgotten guest,
    Sweet murmurers of everlasting rest,
      For whom glad days have ever yet to run,
      And moments are as ?s, and the sun
    But ever sunken half-way toward the west.

    Often to me who heard you in your day,
      With close wrapt ears, it could not choose but seem
    That earth, our mother, searching in what way,
      Men's hearts might know her spirit's inmost dream,
        Ever at rest beneath life's change and stir,
        Made you her soul, and bade you pipe for her.
