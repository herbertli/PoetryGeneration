     Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon
       How can ye blume sae fair!
     How can ye chant, ye little birds,
       And I sae fu' o' care!

     Thou'll break my heart, thou bonnie bird
       That sings upon the bough;
     Thou minds me o' the happy days
       When my fause Luve was true.

     Thou'll break my heart, thou bonnie bird
       That sings beside thy mate;
     For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
       And wist na o' my fate.

     Aft hae I roved by bonnie Doon
       To see the woodbine twine,
     And ilka bird sang o' its love;
       And sae did I o' mine.

     Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose,
       Frae aff its thorny tree;
     And my fause luver staw the rose,
       But left the thorn wi' me.
