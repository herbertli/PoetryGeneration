THE CAVALIER'S SONG.


  A steed! a steed of matchlesse speed,
    A sword of metal keene!
  All else to noble heartes is drosse,
    All else on earth is meaue.
  The neighyinge of the war-horse prowde,
    The rowlinge of the drum,
  The clangor of the trumpet lowde,
    Be soundes from heaven that come;
  And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,
    Whenas their war-cryes swell,
  May tole from heaven an angel bright,
    And rouse a fiend from hell.

  Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,
    And don your helmes amaine;
  Deathe's couriers, fame and honor, call
    Us to the field againe.
  No shrewish feares shall fill our eye
    When the sword-hilt's in our hand--
  Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe
    For the fayrest of the land;
  Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
    Thus weepe and puling crye;
  Our business is like men to fight,
    And hero-like to die!

WILLIAM MOTHERWELL.
