  O thou art Character--art only those
      Who formed the good and great by thought, or deed.
      All others are not worth a moment's heed,--
  Mere prairie dogs, who raise gold hills in rows--
  When gazing at thy glory; for that grows
      With Freedom from all foul untruths; with lead
      In art for weal; with science for all woes;
  With hate of thrall and help for all unfreed.

  No mere foot-shadow, on time's wall, art thou,
      Without eye-sparkle, swing of arm, warm flow
      From heart to vain, and cheeks with health of glow.
  Oh, 'tis eternal heights reflect thy brow
  And shoulders, that avert man's overthrow,
      Threatened all times, and never more than now.
