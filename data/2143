    Yearning upon the faint rose-curves that flit
      About her child-sweet mouth and innocent cheek,
      And in her eyes watching with eyes all meek
    The light and shadow of laughter, I would sit
    Mute, knowing our two souls might never knit;
      As if a pale proud lily-flower should seek
      The love of some red rose, but could not speak
    One word of her blithe tongue to tell of it.

    For oh, my Love was sunny-lipped and stirred
      With all swift light and sound and gloom not long
    Retained; I, with dreams weighed, that ever heard
      Sad burdens echoing through the loudest throng
    She, the wild song of some May-merry bird;
      I, but the listening maker of a song.
