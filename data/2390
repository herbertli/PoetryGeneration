  Yet faithful still 'mid woe and doubt
    One woman's loyal heart--whose pain
  Filled it with pure celestial light--
  Shone starry-constant like the North,
    Or that still radiance beaming forth
    From sacred lights in some lone fane.
  But he whose ring Jemima wore,
  By want and weariness all unstrung,
  Though strong and honest of heart and young,
  Shrank at the blast that pierced so frore--
  Like a huge, invisible bird of prey
  Furious launched from Labrador
  And the granite cliffs of Saguenay!

  Along the bleak Dead River's banks
  They forced amain their frozen way;
  But ever from the thinning ranks
  Shapes of ice would reel and fall,
  Human shapes, whose dying prayer
  Floated, a mute white mist, in air;
  The crowding snow their pall.

  Spectre-like Famine drew near;
  Her doom-word hummed in his ear:
  Ah, weak were woman's hands to reach
  And save him from the hellish charms
  And wizard motion of those arms!
  Yet only noble womanhood
  The wife her dauntless part could teach:
  She shared with him the last dry food
  And thronged with hopefulness her speech,
  As when hard by her home the flood
  Of rushing Conestoga fills
  Its depth afresh from springtide rills!

  All, all in vain!
  For far behind the invading rout
    These two were left alone;
  And in the waste their wildest shout
    Seemed but a smothered groan.
  Like sheeted wanderers from the grave
  They moved, and yet seemed not to stir,
  As icy gorge and sere-leaf'd grove
  Of withered oak and shrouded fir
  Were passed, and onward still they strove;
  While the loud wind's artillery clave
  The air, and furious sleety rain
  Swung like a sword above the plain!
