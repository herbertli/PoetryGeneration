 The sun falls warm: the southern winds awake:
 The air seethes upward with a steamy shiver:
 Each dip of the road is now a crystal lake,
 And every rut a little dancing river.
 Through great soft clouds that sunder overhead
 The deep sky breaks as pearly blue as summer:
 Out of a cleft beside the river's bed
 Flaps the black crow, the first demure newcomer.
 The last seared drifts are eating fast away
 With glassy tinkle into glittering laces:
 Dogs lie asleep, and little children play
 With tops and marbles in the sunbare places;
 And I that stroll with many a thoughtful pause
 Almost forget that winter ever was.
