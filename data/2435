  Dear face--bright, glinting hair;
    Dear life, whose heart is mine--
  The thought of you is prayer,
    The love of you divine.

  In starlight, or in rain;
    In the sunset's shrouded glow;
  Ever, with joy or pain,
    To you my quick thoughts go

  Like winds or clouds, that fleet
    Across the hungry space
  Between, and find you, sweet,
    Where life again wins grace.

  Now, as in that once young
    Year that so softly drew
  My heart to where it clung,
    I long for, gladden in you.

  And when in the silent hours
    I whisper your sacred name,
  Like an altar-fire it showers
    My blood with fragrant flame!

  Perished is all that grieves;
    And lo, our old-new joys
  Are gathered as in sheaves,
    Held in love's equipoise.

  Ours is the love that lives;
    Its springtime blossoms blow
  'Mid the fruit that autumn gives,
    And its life outlasts the snow.
