FROM "THE CHURCH PORCH."


  Thou whose sweet youth and early hopes enhance
  Thy rate and price, and mark thee for a treasure.
  Hearken unto a Verser, who may chance
  Rhyme thee to good, and make a bait of pleasure:
    A verse may find him who a sermon flies
    And turn delight into a sacrifice.

  When thou dost purpose aught (within thy power),
  Be sure to doe it, though it be but small;
  Constancie knits the bones, and make us stowre,
  When wanton pleasures beckon us to thrall.
    Who breaks his own bond, forfeiteth himself:
    What nature made a ship, he makes a shelf.
