    The darkness brings no quiet here, the light
      No waking: ever on my blinded brain
      The flare of lights, the rush, and cry, and strain,
    The engines' scream, the hiss and thunder smite:
    I see the hurrying crowds, the clasp, the flight,
      Faces that touch, eyes that are dim with pain:
      I see the hoarse wheels turn, and the great train
    Move labouring out into the bourneless night.

    So many souls within its dim recesses,
      So many bright, so many mournful eyes:
    Mine eyes that watch grow fixed with dreams and guesses;
      What threads of life, what hidden histories,
    What sweet or passionate dreams and dark distresses,
      What unknown thoughts, what various agonies!
