  With my beloved I lingered late one night.
    At last the hour when I must leave her came:
    But, as I turned, a fear I could not name
  Possessed me that the long sweet evening might
  Prelude some sudden storm, whereby delight
    Should perish. What if death, ere dawn, should claim
    One of us? What, though living, not the same
  Each should appear to each in morning-light?

  Changed did I find her, truly, the next day:
    Ne'er could I see her as of old again.
  That strange mood seemed to draw a cloud away,
    And let her beauty pour through every vein
  Sunlight and life, part of me. Thus the lover
  With each new morn a new world may discover.
