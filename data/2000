When slim Sophia mounts her horse
  And paces down the avenue,
It seems an inward melody
      She paces to.

Each narrow hoof is lifted high
  Beneath the dark enclustering pines,
A silver ray within his bit
      And bridle shines.

His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,
  And streams upon the shadowy air,
The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,
      His mistress' hair.

Her habit flows in darkness down,
  Upon the stirrup rests her foot,
Her brow is lifted, as if earth
      She heeded not.

'Tis silent in the avenue,
  The sombre pines are mute of song,
The blue is dark, there moves no breeze
      The boughs among.

When slim Sophia mounts her horse
  And paces down the avenue,
It seems an inward melody
      She paces to.
