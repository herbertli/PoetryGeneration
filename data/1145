BY THE ALMA RIVER.

[September 20, 1854,]


  Willie, fold your little hands;
    Let it drop,--that "soldier" toy;
  Look where father's picture stands,--
    Father, that here kissed his boy
  Not a mouth since,--father kind,
  Who this night may (never mind
  Mother's sob, my Willie dear)
  Cry out loud that He may hear
  Who is God of battles,--cry,
  "God keep father safe this day
      By the Alma River!"

  Ask no more, child. Never heed
    Either Russ, or Frank, or Turk;
  Right of nations, trampled creed,
    Chance-poised victory's bloody work;
  Any flag i' the wind may roll
  On thy heights, Sevastopol!
  Willie, all to you and me
  Is that spot, whate'er it be,
  Where he stands--no other word--
  _Stands_--God sure the child's prayers heard--
      Near the Alma River.

  Willie, listen to the bells
    Ringing in the town to-day;
  That's for victory. No knell swells
    For the many swept away,--
  Hundreds, thousands. Let us weep,
  We, who need not,--just to keep
  Reason clear in thought and brain
  Till the morning comes again;
  Till the third dread morning tell
  Who they were that fought and--_fell_
      By the Alma River.

  Come, we'll lay us down, my child;
    Poor the bed is,--poor and hard;
  But thy father, far exiled,
    Sleeps upon the open sward,
  Dreaming of us two at home;
  Or, beneath the starry dome,
  Digs out trenches in the dark,
  Where he buries--Willie, mark!--
  Where _he buries_ those who died
  Fighting--fighting at his side--
      By the Alma River.

  Willie, Willie, go to sleep;
    God will help us, O my boy!
  He will make the dull hours creep
    Faster, and send news of joy;
  When I need not shrink to meet
  Those great placards in the street,
  That for weeks will ghastly stare
  In some eyes--child, say that prayer
  Once again,--a different one,--
  Say, "O God! Thy will be done
      By the Alma River."

DINAH MARIA MULOCK CRAIK.
