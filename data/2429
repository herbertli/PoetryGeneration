  You say these jewels were accurst--
    With evil omen fraught.
  You should have known it from the first!
    This was the truth they taught:

  No treasured thing in heaven or earth
    Holds potency more weird
  Than our hearts hold, that throb from birth
    With wavering flames insphered.

  And when from me the gems you took,
    On that strange April day,
  My nature, too, I gave, that shook
    With passion's fateful play.

  The mingled fate my love should give
    In these mute emblems shone,
  That more intensely burn and live--
    While I am turned to stone.
