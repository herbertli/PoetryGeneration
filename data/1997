"Sailorman, I'll give to you
  My bright silver penny,
If out to sea you'll sail me
  And my dear sister Jenny."

"Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye
  And your dear sister Jenny,
But pay she shall her golden locks
  Instead of your penny."

They sail away, they sail away,
  O fierce the winds blew!
The foam flew in clouds,
  And dark the night grew!

And all the wild sea-water
  Climbed steep into the boat;
Back to the shore again
  Sail they will not.

Drowned is the sailorman,
  Drowned is sweet Jenny,
And drowned in the deep sea
  A bright silver penny.
