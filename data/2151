    Move on, light hands, so strongly tenderly,
      Now with dropped calm and yearning undersong,
      Now swift and loud, tumultuously strong,
    And I in darkness, sitting near to thee,
    Shall only hear, and feel, but shall not see,
      One hour made passionately bright with dreams,
      Keen glimpses of life's splendour, dashing gleams
    Of what we would, and what we cannot be.

    Surely not painful ever, yet not glad,
      Shall such hours be to me, but blindly sweet,
        Sharp with all yearning and all fact at strife,
      Dreams that shine by with unremembered feet,
        And tones that like far distance make this life
    Spectral and wonderful and strangely sad.
