SEMPRONIUS' SPEECH FOR WAR.

FROM "CATO," ACT II. SC. 1.


    My voice is still for war.
  Gods! can a Roman senate long debate
  Which of the two to choose, slavery or death?
  No; let us rise at once, gird on our swords,
  And at the head of our remaining troops
  Attack the foe, break through the thick array
  Of his thronged legions, and charge home upon him.
  Perhaps some arm, more lucky than the rest,
  May reach his heart, and free the world from bondage.
  Rise! Fathers, rise! 'tis Rome demands your help:
  Rise, and revenge her slaughtered citizens,
  Or share their fate! The corpse of half her senate
  Manures the fields of Thessaly, while we
  Sit here deliberating, in cold debate,
  If we should sacrifice our lives to honor,
  Or wear them out in servitude and chains.
  Rouse up, for shame! our brothers of Pharsalia
  Point at their wounds, and cry aloud,--"To battle!"
  Great Pompey's shade complains that we are slow,
  And Scipio's ghost walks unrevenged amongst us.

JOSEPH ADDISON.
