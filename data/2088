    Out of the Northland sombre weirds are calling;
      A shadow falleth southward day by day;
    Sad summer's arms grow cold; his fire is falling;
      His feet draw back to give the stern one way.

    It is the voice and shadow of the slayer,
      Slayer of loves, sweet world, slayer of dreams;
    Make sad thy voice with sober plaint and prayer;
      Make gray thy woods, and darken all thy streams.

    Black grows the river, blacker drifts the eddy:
      The sky is grey; the woods are cold below:
    Oh make thy bosom, and thy sad lips ready,
      For the cold kisses of the folding snow.
