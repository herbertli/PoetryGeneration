    But even as he moans in such dark mood,
      His wandering eyes upon the goblet fall.
    Oh, dreaming heart! Oh, strange ingratitude!
      So to forget his lady's lingering call,
    Her parting gift, so rich, so crimson-hued,
      The lover's draught, that shall be cure for all.
    He lifts the goblet lightly from its place,
    And smiles, and rears it with his courtly grace.
