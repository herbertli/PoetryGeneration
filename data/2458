  Those that in the combat perished,--
    Hostile shapes and forms of friends,--
  Those we hated, those we cherished,
    Meet the pageant where it ends.
  Flash of steel and tears forgiving
    Blend in splendor. Hark, the knell!
  Comrades ghostly join the living--
    Dreaming, chanting: "All is well."
  They receive the General sleeping,
    Him of spirit pure and large:
  Him they draw into their keeping
    Evermore, in faithful charge.
