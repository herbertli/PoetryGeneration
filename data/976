PURGATORY.

    PRAYER.

    CANTO VI.


                            When I was freed
  From all those spirits, who prayed for others' prayers
  To hasten on their state of blessedness;
  Straight I began: "O thou, my luminary!
  It seems expressly in thy text denied,
  That Heaven's supreme decree can ever bend
  To supplication; yet with this design
  Do these entreat. Can then their hope be vain?
  Or is thy saying not to be revealed?"
  He thus to me: "Both what I write is plain,
  And these deceived not in their hope; if well
  Thy mind consider, that the sacred height
  Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame
  In a short moment all fulfils, which he,
  Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.
  Besides, when I this point concluded thus,
  By praying no defect could be supplied:
  Because the prayer had none access to God.
  Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
  Contented, unless she assure thee so,
  Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light:
  I know not if thou take me right; I mean
  Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above,
  Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."
