     A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
       A wind that follows fast
     And fills the white and rustling sail
       And bends the gallant mast;
     And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
       While like the eagle free
     Away the good ship flies, and leaves
       Old England on the lee.

     O for a soft and gentle wind!
       I heard a fair one cry;
     But give to me the snoring breeze
       And white waves heaving high;
     And white waves heaving high, my lads,
       The good ship tight and free--
     The world of waters is our home,
       And merry men are we.

     There's tempest in yon horn?moon,
       And lightning in yon cloud;
     But hark the music, mariners!
       The wind is piping loud;
     The wind is piping loud, my boys,
       The lightning flashes free--
     While the hollow oak our palace is,
       Our heritage the sea.

     A. CUNNINGHAM.
