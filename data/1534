  A spirit passed the Sun, the Moon and Star,
      And dwelled and dreamed in darkness all its own.
      The music of the spheres, though thither blown,
  As faint as fragrance from a flower afar,
  Disturbed this spirit's ear, attuned to jar
      Of orb with orb; for hate of light, truth known,
      Fashions hot worlds which, cooled to clay and stone,
  Clash, rising toward calm Heaven, which they would mar.

  Ah, if where love was not, he smiled elate,
      His smile at God returned, a lightening flash
      That shattered him. He saw his planets clash,
  Burst and, then, by the downward law of hate,
  Sink and leave not a single spark, nor ash,
      For the new firmament he would create.
