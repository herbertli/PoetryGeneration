  God said to Wrong: "No further shalt thou go."
      This, Monroe heard and held, then, in his heart.
      It was this he repeated, when on chart
  He made his markings, checking Freedom's foe.
  God never grants to Wrong the right to grow;
      Because He sets its bounds, does not impart
      His blessing on its growth, more than its start;
  His blessing goes to Right, to overthrow.

  Oh, let thine eyes for migratory flight
      Speed southward! Passing Prejudice's Lake,
      Green-crusted with stagnation which some take
  For verdure, they will see from Andes' height,
  How Freedom's battle forms the red day-break,
      And tides are swells from thrall, hurled deep from sight.
