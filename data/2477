        For, if we say God wills,
        Shall we then idly deny Him
        Care of each host in the fight?
        His thunder was here in the hills
        When the guns were loud in July;
        And the flash of the musketry's light
        Was sped by a ray from God's eye.
        In its good and its evil the scheme
        Was framed with omnipotent hand,
        Though the battle of men was a dream
        That they could but half understand.
        Can the purpose of God pass by him?
        Nay; it was sure, and was wrought
        Under inscrutable powers:
        Bravely the two armies fought
  And left the land, that was greater than they, still theirs and ours!
