  In thy descent through azures, all aglow
      With circling spheres, the beauty of each blaze,
      And grandeur, then, of all, entrance thy gaze.
  Thou thinkest, why not thus all life below?
  Perceiving, then that all the breezes blow
      Upward and onward, in the skyey maze,
      Thou wouldst go back and start with them, to raise
  A new creation from chaotic throe.

  Thou seest plainly that without that breeze,
      The breath of God, all that thou couldst create,
      Were lifeless, save to turn on thee with hate,
  And chase an age with grim atrocities;
      But with that breath, thou couldst raise life to mate
      The Planet's splendor, in the azures Peace.
