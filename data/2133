    "And though 'twas cruel hard of me to try
      Thy faithful heart with such a fearful test,
    Yet now thou canst be happy, sweet, as I
      Am wondrous happy in thy truth confessed.
    To haggard death indeed thou needst not fly
      To find the softness of thy lady's breast;
    For such a gift was never death's to give,
    But thou shalt have me for thy love, and live.
