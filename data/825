VESPER HYMN.


  Now, on sea and land descending,
    Brings the night its peace profound:
  Let our vesper hymn be blending
    With the holy calm around.
  Soon as dies the sunset glory,
    Stars of heaven shine out above,
  Telling still the ancient story--
    Their Creator's changeless love.

  Now, our wants and burdens leaving
    To his care who cares for all,
  Cease we fearing, cease we grieving;
    At his touch our burdens fall.
  As the darkness deepens o'er us,
    Lo! eternal stars arise;
  Hope and Faith and Love rise glorious,
    Shining in the Spirit's skies.

SAMUEL LONGFELLOW.
