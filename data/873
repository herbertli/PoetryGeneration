NOTHING BUT LEAVES.


  Nothing but leaves; the spirit grieves
    Over a wasted life;
  Sin committed while conscience slept,
  Promises made, but never kept,
    Hatred, battle, and strife;
      _Nothing but leaves_!

  Nothing but leaves; no garnered sheaves
    Of life's fair, ripened grain;
  Words, idle words, for earnest deeds;
  We sow our seeds,--lo! tares and weeds:
    We reap, with toil and pain,
      _Nothing but leaves_!

  Nothing but leaves; memory weaves
    No veil to screen the past:
  As we retrace our weary way,
  Counting each lost and misspent day,
    We find, sadly, at last,
      _Nothing but leaves_!

  And shall we meet the Master so,
    Bearing our withered leaves?
  The Saviour looks for perfect fruit,
  We stand before him, humbled, mute;
  Waiting the words he breathes,--
      "_Nothing but leaves_?"

LUCY E. AKERMAN.
