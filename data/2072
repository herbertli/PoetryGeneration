    Once on the year's last eve in my mind's might
      Sitting in dreams, not sad, nor quite elysian,
      Balancing all 'twixt wonder and derision,
    Methought my body and all this world took flight,
    And vanished from me, as a dream, outright;
      Leaning out thus in sudden strange decision,
      I saw as it were in the flashing of a vision,
    Far down between the tall towers of the night,
      Borne by great winds in awful unison,
        The teeming masses of mankind sweep by,
        Even as a glittering river with deep sound
      And innumerable banners, rolling on
        Over the starry border glooms that bound
          The last gray space in dim eternity.

    And all that strange unearthly multitude
      Seemed twisted in vast seething companies,
      That evermore with hoarse and terrible cries
    And desperate encounter at mad feud
    Plunged onward, each in its implacable mood
      Borne down over the trampled blazonries
      Of other faiths and other phantasies,
    Each following furiously, and each pursued;
      So sped they on with tumult vast and grim,
         But ever meseemed beyond them I could see
         White-haloed groups that sought perpetually
           The figure of one crowned and sacrificed;
      And faint, far forward, floating tall and dim,
           The banner of our Lord and Master, Christ.
