  The outlaws in our country are the wretches,
      Who wreck the legislatures with their gold,
      And with the ruins, form a high stronghold
  To sally from, to what good nature fetches
  From God to man. What though fine graphic sketches
      In magazines show them with shoulders bold
      Against the nights flood-gates of dark and cold?
  All effort is but life in death-throw stretches.

  They are the outlaws, who stop Nature's train
      And take its corn and coal for selfish use;
      Then, put their shoulders to Night's gate, to loose
  Its hinges for a forty-day dark rain,
  To drown all life, that they, like Noah, may cruise
      Through thick drifts of the dead in heart and brain.
