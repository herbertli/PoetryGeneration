    Slow figures in some live remorseless frieze,
      The approaching days escapeless and unguessed,
      With mask and shroud impenetrably dressed;
    Time, whose inexorable destinies
    Bear down upon us like impending seas;
      And the huge presence of this world, at best
      A sightless giant wandering without rest,
    Ag?and mad with many miseries.

    The weight and measure of these things who knows?
      Resting at times beside life's thought-swept stream,
    Sobered and stunned with unexpected blows,
      We scarcely hear the uproar; life doth seem,
    Save for the certain nearness of its woes,
      Vain and phantasmal as a sick man's dream.
