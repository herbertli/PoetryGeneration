  Deep, smoldering colors of the land and sea
  Burn in these stones, that, by some mystery,
  Wrap fire in sleep and never are consumed.
  Scarlet of daybreak, sunset gleams half spent
  In thick white cloud; pale moons that may have lent
  Light to love's grieving; rose-illumined snows,
  And veins of gold no mine depth ever gloomed;
  All these, and green of thin-edged waves, are there.
  I think a tide of feeling through them flows
  With blush and pallor, as if some being of air,--
  Some soul once human,--wandering, in the snare
  Of passion had been caught, and henceforth doomed
  In misty crystal here to lie entombed.

  And so it is, indeed. Here prisoned sleep
  The ardors and the moods and all the pain
  That once within a man's heart throbbed. He gave
  These opals to the woman whom he loved;
  And now, like glinting sunbeams through the rain,
  The rays of thought that through his spirit moved
  Leap out from these mysterious forms again.

  The colors of the jewels laugh and weep
  As with his very voice. In them the wave
  Of sorrow and joy that, with a changing sweep,
  Bore him to misery or else made him blest
  Still surges in melodious, wild unrest.
  So when each gem in place I touch and take,
  It murmurs what he thought or what he spake.
