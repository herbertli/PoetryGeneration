  Oh, weirder grows the whisper into word,
      As sharp as lightening, and as broad of reach,
      As seas, flung down by God to every beach
  Where thirsts a sparrow, or a bleating herd!
  There is no soul through out the land, not stirred;
      For, oh, to glory God gives his own speech
      When darkness, raised by Gold, declares that each,
  Hulk-held, is good but for the wolf and bird.

  Is Gold grown conscious, now the Country's King
      That, at his beck, the blood for Freedom spilt
      Shall be accursed, and I, then, for the guilt
  Of dropping not with thud, as he with ring
  At Darkness' feet, be shut in mud and silt
      Forever and with stars, cease, beaconing?
