  The German mother has too long been what
      A Chancellor once called the "Kingdom's Cow."
      Ah, as she bears the droves for slaughter, how
  Her dumb-beast eyes crave pity for her lot!
  See, there she smiles, like loving God forgot--
      All His supernal patience on her brow.
      How long must her grand arch of brain, as now,
  Bear up a universe "of what should not"?

  There, lies she, crushed by troops in hot pursuit
      Of mocking shadows; for be Gain complete,
      What is it but twin brother to defeat?
  Stand up the dead on any bloody route.
  Stoop for no kiss from orphans, at thy feet,
      O Triumph! for ash-cord is all thy fruit.
