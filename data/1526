  Ah, what is Heaven? Such Glory that Sun-light
      Seems darkness, and Mass Music, shell-shut sound.
      What we call senses here, there so abound,
  The soul appears a broadening heaven in flight,
  Feathered and downed with all the stars, whose white
      Is all hues mingled. Oh, the awe profound!
      For every moment there, new Heavens astound
  The myriad senses, with God's Love and Might.

  If "Holy, Holy, Holy, Evermore?"
      Be the one chant of angel and of Saint
      Before the Throne, it is their gaspings faint
  Between their transports to high Heavens from lower;
  For, what is love's eternal Firmament
      But Heaven on Heaven, that we may ceaseless soar?
