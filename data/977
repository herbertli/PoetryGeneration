    PRAYER OF PENITENTS.

    CANTO XI.

  "O thou Almighty Father! who dost make
  The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confined,
  But that, with love intenser, there thou view'st
  Thy primal effluence; hallowed be thy name:
  Join, each created being, to extol
  Thy might; for worthy humblest thanks and praise
  Is thy blest Spirit. May thy kingdom's peace
  Come unto us; for we, unless it come,
  With all our striving, thither tend in vain.
  As, of their will, the angels unto thee
  Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne
  With loud hosannas; so of theirs be done
  By saintly men on earth. Grant us, this day,
  Our daily manna, without which he roams
  Through this rough desert retrograde, who most
  Toils to advance his steps. As we to each
  Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou
  Benign, and of our merit take no count.
  'Gainst the old adversary, prove thou not
  Our virtue, easily subdued; but free
  From his incitements, and defeat his wiles.
  This last petition, dearest Lord! is made
  Not for ourselves; since that were needless now;
  But for their sakes who after us remain."
