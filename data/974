PARADISE.


  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    Who doth not crave for rest,
  Who would not seek the happy land
    Where they that loved are blest?
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    The world is growing old;
  Who would not be at rest and free
    Where love is never cold?
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    Wherefore doth death delay?--
  Bright death, that is the welcome dawn
    Of our eternal day;
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    'Tis weary waiting here;
  I long to be where Jesus is,
    To feel, to see him near;
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    I want to sin no more,
  I want to be as pure on earth
    As on thy spotless shore;
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    I greatly long to see
  The special place my dearest Lord
    Is destining for me;
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

  O Paradise, O Paradise,
    I feel 'twill not be long;
  Patience! I almost think I hear
    Faint fragments of thy song;
      Where loyal hearts and true
        Stand ever in the light,
      All rapture through and through,
        In God's most holy sight.

FREDERICK WILLIAM FABER.
