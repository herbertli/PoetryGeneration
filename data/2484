      In vain the mighty endeavor;
      In vain the immortal valor;
    In vain the insurgent life outpoured!
    Faltered the column, spent with shot and sword;
    Its bright hope blanched with sudden pallor;
  While Hancock's trefoil bloomed in triple fame.
  He chose the field; he saved the second day;
    And, honoring here his glorious name,
  Again his phalanx held victorious sway.
  Meade's line stood firm, and volley on volley roared
  Triumphant Union, soon to be restored,
  Strong to defy all foes and fears forever.
    The Ridge was wreathed with angry fire
    As flames rise round a martyr's stake;
  For many a hero on that pyre
    Was offered for our dear land's sake,
    What time in heaven the gray clouds flew
    To mingle with the deathless blue;
    While here, below, the blue and gray
    Melted minglingly away,
  Mirroring heaven, to make another day.
    And we, who are Americans, we pray
      The splendor of strength that Gettysburg knew
  May light the long generations with glorious ray,
      And keep us undyingly true!
