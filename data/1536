  Ah, in the angel-fall from Heaven, is hope?
      The wing-whir discord of the legion's fall
      From God forever, mocks my heart's loud call.
  Empty of beauty from its base to cope,
  The Earth is hollow. Where, then, can I grope
      And not be met by echoes that appal?
      What! shouts my mind, in wonder that I crawl
  And, having skyey wings, in hollows mope.

  Does scent from bloom, or warble from the wood,
      Not atmosphere the un-aerial void
      Twixt thee and beauty, which thy youth enjoyed?
  Fly back to earth, by memory renewed;
  She fills the hollow, echoing hosts destroyed,--
      With Spring, reflecting Heaven's Triumphant Good.
