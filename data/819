LOVE.


  If suddenly upon the street
  My gracious Saviour I should meet,
  And he should say, "As I love thee,
  What love hast thou to offer me?"
  Then what could this poor heart of mine
  Dare offer to that heart divine?

  His eye would pierce my outward show,
  His thought my inmost thought would know;
  And if I said, "I love thee, Lord,"
  He would not heed my spoken word,
  Because my daily life would tell
  If verily I loved him well.

  If on the day or in the place
  Wherein he met me face to face,
  My life could show some kindness done,
  Some purpose formed, some work begun
  For his dear sake, then it were meet
  Love's gift to lay at Jesus' feet.
