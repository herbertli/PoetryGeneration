  If Christ's foreshadowing in Juda's haze
    Was of his grief, 'tis of His triumph, here,
    For, is not His celestrial glory clear
  In Freedom for all men? First, gaseous rays
  In Maryland, then rounded firm full blaze
    In the Republic, it draws every sphere
    Of Human welfare, whether far or near,
  From depths occult to nights with dawns and days.

  The Freedom of the Generation's longing
    Reflects Lord Christ in glory, hour by hour,
    With more distinctness, as you, with His power,
  Free heart and brain from every brother-wronging,
  And give your offspring, these, as flesh and dower,
    To live and lead the millions, hither thronging.
