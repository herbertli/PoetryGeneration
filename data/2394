  Then to the leader she was brought,
  And spoke her simply loyal thought.
  If, 'mid the shame of after-days,
  The man who wronged his country's trust
  (Yet now in worth outweighed all praise)
  Remembered what this woman wrought,
  It should have bowed him to the dust!
  "Humbly my soldier-husband tried
  To do his part. He served,--and died.
  But honor did not die. His name
  And honor--bringing both, I came;
  And this his rifle, here, to show,
  While far away the tired heart sleeps,
  To-day his faith with you he keeps!"

  Proudly the war bride, ending so,
  Sank breathless in the dumb white snow.
