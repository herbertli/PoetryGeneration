THE CHRIST.


  He might have reared a palace at a word,
  Who sometimes had not where to lay His head.
  Time was when He who nourished crowds with bread,
  Would not one meal unto Himself afford.
  He healed another's scratch, His own side bled;
  Side, hands and feet with cruel piercings gored.
  Twelve legions girded with angelic sword
  Stood at His beck, the scorned and buffeted.
  Oh, wonderful the wonders left undone!
  Yet not more wonderful than those He wrought!
  Oh, self-restraint, surpassing human thought!
  To have all power, yet be as having none!
  Oh, self-denying love, that thought alone
  For needs of others, never for its own!

RICHARD CHENEVIX TRENCH.
