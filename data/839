THE RELIGION OF HUDIBRAS.

    FROM "HUDIBRAS," PART I.


    He was of that stubborn crew
  Of errant saints, whom all men grant
  To be the true church militant;
  Such as do build their faith upon
  The holy text of pike and gun;
  Decide all controversies by
  Infallible artillery,
  And prove their doctrine orthodox
  By apostolic blows and knocks;
  Call fire, and sword, and desolation
  A godly, thorough Reformation,
  Which always must be carried on
  And still be doing, never done;
  As if religion were intended
  For nothing else but to be mended.
  A sect whose chief devotion lies
  In odd perverse antipathies;
  In falling out with that or this,
  And finding somewhat still amiss;
  More peevish, cross, and splenetic,
  Than dog distract, or monkey sick;
  That with more care keep holiday
  The wrong than others the right way;
  Compound for sins they are inclined to,
  By damning those they have no mind to;
  Still so perverse and opposite,
  As if they worshipped God for spite;
  The self-same thing they will abhor
  One way, and long another for.

SAMUEL BUTLER.
