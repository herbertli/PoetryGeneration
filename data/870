SELF-INQUIRY.


  Let not soft slumber close my eyes,
  Before I've recollected thrice
  The train of action through the day!
  Where have my feet chose out their way?
  What have I learnt, where'er I've been,
  From all I have heard, from all I've seen?
  What know I more that's worth the knowing?
  What have I done that's worth the doing?
  What have I sought that I should shun?
  What duty have I left undone?
  Or into what new follies run?
    These self-inquiries are the road
    That leads to virtue and to God.

ISAAC WATTS.
