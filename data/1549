  Hark! 'tis the laughter of the stars at Earth,
      And Nature's, too, with every pitch of voice.
      Earth's carnival of sheer grotesque and noise,
  Where, gagged and manacled, walk Peace and Mirth,
  Shows Britain now, a beast of broadening girth,
      Set out to crush World Freedom. He destroys,
      And thinks his bear-like rearing, planet poise
  That is to influence the world's new birth.

  The stars are kind, as all the ages know;
      The sense of humor twinkles in their eyes,
      At Earth's strange follies; but this beast would try
  To thrust aside the planets, and make woe,
  The fortune of World Freedom! That is why
      The stars laugh, and all nature jeers the show.
