  O Daughters of the brave, well ye abjure
      The fiend and all his works. Ye know his smiles
      Are fire-fly flare at gloaming, lighting miles
  Of snake-boughed forests down to swamps, impure
  From mind and soul decay; hence are heart-sure
      That creed and racial hatreds are his wiles,
      For God is Love, and Love draws, reconsiles,
  And is the strength that makes our land endure.

  O Mothers, as you lift your babes and gaze
      Into their eyes, your love runs through their vains
      In crimson flushes--oh, your love that pains
  At any of God's creatures hurt! that stays;
  The heavens may pass away, but that remains,
      Being of Christ, who walks earth Mother-ways.
