  O fair, full moon! I look close at thy face.
      Thou must be happy, being in the skys;
      And, yet, thy flush grows pallor to mine eyes.
  Thou art as one, who breathless after chase,
  Would rest, but dreads to check her onward pace.
      O fugitive from where no fledgling flies,
      No bee finds bud, and where red billows rise,
  Engulfing down dark years, the Human Race!

  O thou pale moon, who hast companioned Man
      Through every darkness since the night's first fall!
      Hast thou, along thy foot-worn, azure wall,
  Ever seen seas so hard for hope to span,
  As this red surge, that in a spring so small,
      A bird could beak it up, its flood began?
