    She dashes from her brow the pented hood;
      The dusky robe falls rustling to her feet;
    And there she stands, as aye in dreams she stood.
      Ah, Nino, see! Sure man did never meet
    So warm a flower from such a sombre bud,
      So trembling fair, so wan, so pallid sweet.
    Aye, Nino, down like saint upon thy knee,
    And soothe her hands with kisses warm and free.
