    As a weed beneath the ocean,
      As a pool beneath a tree
    Answers with each breath or motion
      An imperious mastery;

    So my spirit swift with passion
      Finds in every look a sign,
    Catching in some wondrous fashion
      Every mood that governs thine.

    In a moment it will borrow,
      Flashing in a gusty train,
    Laughter and desire and sorrow
      Anger and delight and pain.
