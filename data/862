  For now, and since first break of dawn, the fiend.
  Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;
  And on his quest, where likeliest he might find
  The only two of mankind, but in them
  The whole included race, his purposed prey.
  In bower and field he sought where any tuft
  Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,
  Their tendance, or plantation for delight;
  By fountain or by shady rivulet
  He sought them both, but wished his hap might find
  Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope
  Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,
  Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
  Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,
  Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round
  About her glowed.
