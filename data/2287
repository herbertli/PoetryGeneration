 A little while, a year agone,
   I knew her for a romping child,
 A dimple and a glance that shone
   With idle mischief when she smiled.

 To-day she passed me in the press,
   And turning with a quick surprise
 I wondered at her stateliness,
   I wondered at her altered eyes.

 To me the street was just the same,
   The people and the city's stir;
 But life had kindled into flame,
   And all the world was changed for her.

 I watched her in the crowded ways,
   A noble form, a queenly head,
 With all the woman in her gaze,
   The conscious woman in her tread.
