FLODDEN FIELD.

[September, 1513.]

FROM "MARMION," CANTO VI.


  A moment then Lord Marmion stayed,
  And breathed his steed, his men arrayed,
    Then forward moved his band,
  Until, Lord Surrey's rear-guard won,
  He halted by a cross of stone,
  That, on a hillock standing lone,
    Did all the field command.

  Hence might they see the full array
  Of either host for deadly fray;
  Their marshalled lines stretched east and west,
    And fronted north and south,
  And distant salutation past
    From the loud cannon-mouth;
  Not in the close successive rattle
  That breathes the voice of modern battle,
    But slow and far between.--
  The hillock gained, Lord Marmion stayed:
  "Here, by this cross," he gently said,
    "You well may view the scene;
  Here shalt thou tarry, lovely Clare:
  O, think of Marmion in thy prayer!--
  Thou wilt not?--well,--no less my care
  Shall, watchful, for thy weal prepare.--
  You, Blount and Eustace, are her guard,
    With ten picked archers of my train;
  With England if the day go hard,
    To Berwick speed amain,--
  But, if we conquer, cruel maid,
  My spoils shall at your feet be laid,
    When here we meet again."
  He waited not for answer there,
  And would not mark the maid's despair,
    Nor heed the discontented look
  From either squire: but spurred amain,
  And, dashing through the battle-plain,
    His way to Surrey took.
