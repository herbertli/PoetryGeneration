    O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
  When the airy war doth wane,
  And the storm to the east hath flown,
  Cloaked close in the whirling wind,
  There's a voice still left behind
  In each heavy-hearted tree,
  Charged with tearful memory
  Of the vanished rain:
  From their leafy lashes wet
  Drip the dews of fresh regret
  For the lover that's gone!
  All else is still;
  Yet the stars are listening,
  And low o'er the wooded hill
  Hangs, upon listless wing
  Outspread, a shape of damp, blue cloud,
  Watching, like a bird of evil
  That knows nor mercy nor reprieval,
  The slow and silent death of the pallid moon.
