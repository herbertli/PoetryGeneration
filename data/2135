    "Nay, Nino, kneel not; let me hear thee speak.
      We must not tarry long; the dawn is nigh."
    So rises he, for very gladness weak;
      But half in fear that yet the dream may fly,
    He touches mutely mouth and brow and cheek;
      Till in his ear she 'gins to plead and sigh:
    "Dear love, forgive me for that cruel tale,
    That stung thine heart and made thy lips so pale."
