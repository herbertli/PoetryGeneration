EXAMPLE.


  We scatter seeds with careless hand,
    And dream we ne'er shall see them more;
      But for a thousand years
      Their fruit appears,
  In weeds that mar the land,
    Or healthful store.

  The deeds we do, the words we say,--
    Into still air they seem to fleet,
      We count them ever past;
      But they shall last,--
  In the dread judgment they
    And we shall meet.

  I charge thee by the years gone by,
    For the love's sake of brethren dear,
      Keep thou the one true way,
      In work and play,
  Lest in that world their cry
    Of woe thou hear.

JOHN KEBLE.
