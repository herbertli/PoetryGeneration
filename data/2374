  On this day to life she came--
      May-Rose, my May-Rose!
  With scented breeze, with flowered flame,
  She touched the earth and took her name
                  Of May, Rose.

  Here, to-day, she grows and flowers--
      May-Rose, my May-Rose.
  All my life with light she dowers,
  And colors all the coming hours
                  With May, Rose!
