SIT DOWN, SAD SOUL.


  Sit down, sad soul, and count
    The moments flying;
  Come, tell the sweet amount
    That's lost by sighing!
  How many smiles?--a score?
  Then laugh, and count no more;
    For day is dying!

  Lie down, sad soul, and sleep,
    And no more measure
  The flight of time, nor weep
    The loss of leisure;
  But here, by this lone stream,
  Lie down with us, and dream
      Of starry treasure!

  We dream: do thou the same;
    We love,--forever;
  We laugh, yet few we shame,--
    The gentle never.
  Stay, then, till sorrow dies;
  Then--hope and happy skies
    Are thine forever!
