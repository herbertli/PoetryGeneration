  The fight in Ireland is 'twixt Man and Brute.
      A lion with the sea-surge for his mane,
      Is there hurled back by Man with proud disdain,
  Although heart-drained with gash from head to foot.
  Oh, in that Eden of Forbidden Fruit,
      How Satan, searching for a snake in vain,
      Fumed forth a monster from his heart and brain--
  The Lion--as the serpent's substitute!

  Oh, all ye peoples of the World draw nigh!
      Stand on the bodies of eight centuries,
      Struck dead with horror; for, raised thus, one sees
  In Erin, torn, a soul that cannot die,
  And that its struggle is Humanity's
      Against the fiend, who would give God the lie.
