WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER.


  Dearest love, do you remember
    When we last did meet,
  How you told me that you loved me
    Kneeling at my feet?
  Oh, how proud you stood before me
    In your suit of blue,
  When you vowed to me and country
    Ever to be true.

  _Chorus.--Weeping, sad and lonely,
              Hopes and fears, how vain;
              Yet praying
              When this cruel war is over.
              Praying that we meet again._

  When the summer breeze is sighing
    Mournfully along,
  Or when autumn leaves are falling,
    Sadly breathes the song.
  Oft in dreams I see thee lying
    On the battle plain,
  Lonely, wounded, even dying,
    Calling, but in vain.
  _Chorus.--Weeping, sad,_ etc.

  If, amid the din of battle,
    Nobly you should fall,
  Far away from those who love you,
    None to hear you call,
  Who would whisper words of comfort?
    Who would soothe your pain?
  Ah, the many cruel fancies
    Ever in my brain!
  _Chorus.--Weeping, sad,_ etc.

  But our country called you, darling,
    Angels cheer your way!
  While our nation's sons are fighting,
    We can only pray.
  Nobly strike for God and country,
    Let all nations see
  How we love the starry banner,
    Emblem of the free.

  _Chorus.--Weeping, sad and lonely,
              Hopes and fears, how vain;
              Yet praying
              When this cruel war is over,
              Praying that we meet again._
