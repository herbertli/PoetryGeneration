THE FIGHT OF FAITH.

    [The author of this poem, one of the victims of the
    persecuting Henry VIII., was burnt to death at Smithfield
    in 1546. It was made and sung by her while a prisoner in
    Newgate.]


  Like as the arm?Knighte,
  Appointed to the fielde.
  With this world wil I fight,
  And faith shal be my shilde.

  Faith is that weapon stronge,
  Which wil not faile at nede;
  My foes therefore amonge,
  Therewith wil I precede.

  As it is had in strengthe,
  And forces of Christes waye,
  It wil prevaile at lengthe,
  Though all the devils saye _naye_.

  Faithe of the fathers olde
  Obtain?right witness,
  Which makes me verye bolde
  To fear no worldes distress.

  I now rejoice in harte,
  And hope bides me do so;
  For Christ wil take my part,
  And ease me of my we.

  Thou sayst, Lord, whoso knocke,
  To them wilt thou attende;
  Undo, therefore, the locke,
  And thy stronge power sende.

  More enemies now I have
  Than heeres upon my head;
  Let them not me deprave,
  But fight thou in my steade.

  On thee my care I cast,
  For all their cruell spight;
  I set not by their hast,
  For thou art my delight.

  I am not she that list
  My anker to let fall
  For every drislinge mist;
  My shippe's substancial.

  Not oft I use to wright
  In prose, nor yet in ryme;
  Yet wil I shewe one sight,
  That I sawe in my time:

  I sawe a royall throne,
  Where Justice shulde have sitte;
  But in her steade was One
  Of moody cruell witte.

  Absorpt was rightwisness,
  As by the raginge floude;
  Sathan, in his excess,
  Sucte up the guiltlesse bloude.

  Then thought I,--Jesus, Lorde,
  When thou shalt judge us all,
  Harde is it to recorde
  On these men what will fall.

  Yet, Lorde, I thee desire,
  For that they doe to me,
  Let them not taste the hire
  Of their iniquitie.

ANNE ASKEWE.
