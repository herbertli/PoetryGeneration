SWITZERLAND.

FROM "WILLIAM TELL."


    Once Switzerland was free! With what a pride
  I used to walk these hills,--look up to heaven,
  And bless God that it was so! It was free
  From end to end, from cliff to lake 'twas free!
  Free as our torrents are, that leap our rocks,
  And plough our valleys, without asking leave;
  Or as our peaks, that wear their caps of snow
  In very presence of the regal sun!
  How happy was I in it then! I loved
  Its very storms. Ay, often have I sat
  In my boat at night, when, midway o'er the lake,
  The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge
  The wind came roaring,--I have sat and eyed
  The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled
  To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head,
  And think--I had no master save his own!

JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES.
