    As one within a moated tower,
        I lived my life alone;
    And dreamed not other granges' dower,
        Nor ways unlike mine own.
    I thought I loved. But all alone
        As one within a moated tower
    I lived. Nor truly knew
        One other mortal fortune's hour.
    As one within a moated tower,
        One fate alone I knew.
    Who hears afar the break of day
        Before the silvered air
    Reveals her hooded presence gray,
        And she, herself, is there?
    I know not how, but now I see
        The road, the plain, the pluming tree,
    The carter on the wain.
        On my horizon wakes a star.
    The distant hillsides wrinkled far
        Fold many hearts' domain.
    On one the fire-worn forests sweep,
        Above a purple mountain-keep
    And soar to domes of snow.
        One heart has swarded fountains deep
    Where water-lilies blow:
        And one, a cheerful house and yard,
    With curtains at the pane,
        Board-walks down lawns all clover-starred,
    And full-fold fields of grain.
        As one within a moated tower
    I lived my life alone;
        And dreamed not other granges' dower
    Nor ways unlike mine own.
        But now the salt-chased seas uncurled
    And mountains trooped with pine
        Are mine. I look on all the world
    And all the world is mine.

                               _Edith Wyatt_
