    What sound was that? Who knocks like one in dread
      With such swift hands upon his outer door?
    Perhaps some beggar driven from his bed
      By gnawing hunger he can bear no more,
    Or questing traveller with confus?tread,
      Straying, bewildered in the midnight hoar.
    Nino uprises, scared, he knows not how,
    The dreams still pale about his burdened brow.
