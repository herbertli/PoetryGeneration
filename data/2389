  As through that dreary realm he went,
    Followed a shape of dark portent:--
  Pard-like, of furtive eye, with brain
    To treason narrowing, Aaron Burr,
  Moved loyal-seeming in the train,
    Led by the arch-conspirator.
  And craven Enos closed the rear,
  Whose honor's flame died out in fear.
  Not sooner does the dry bough burn
  And into fruitless ashes turn,
  Than he with whispered, false command
  Drew back the hundreds in his hand;
  Fled like a shade; and all forsook.

  Wherever Arnold bent his look,
  Danger and doubt around him hung;
  And pale Disaster, shrouded, flung
  Black omens in his track, as though
  The fingers of a future woe
  Already clutched his life, to wring
  Some expiation for the thing
  That he was yet to do. A chill
  Struck helpless many a steadfast will
  Within the ranks; the very air
  Rang with a thunder-toned despair:
  The hills seemed wandering to and fro,
  Like lost guides blinded by the snow.
