  The cataracts wild leap, turned glittering ice
      In shame's suspension, and crow souls afeeding
      Upon a huge dead body and fast breeding,--
  Is, as a scene, not worth the railroad's price;
  But, oh, if, with "Excelsior" for device,
      Thou climb thy Alpine way, each day exceeding
      The other's height, what throngs would watch thy speeding
  And, for the thrill thou woulds't give them, come twice!

  O Canada! why all this sleigh-bell rhyming?
      'Tis on the reindeer, hope, in speed with me
      To the grand morning, when thou shalt breathe free
  Upon the apex of thine Alpine climbing,
  From foulsome, choaking smells of tyranny,
      Thick from the Great Sea Serpent's inland sliming.
