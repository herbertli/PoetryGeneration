DALLYING WITH TEMPTATION.

    FROM THE FIRST PART OF "WALLENSTEIN," ACT III. SC. 4.


  Wallenstein _(in soliloquy_). Is it possible?
  Is't so? I _can_ no longer what I _would_!
  No longer draw back at my liking! I
  Must _do_ the deed, because I _thought_ of it,
  And fed this heart here with a dream! Because
  I did not scowl temptation from my presence,
  Dallied with thought of possible fulfilment,
  Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain,
  And only kept the road, the access open!
  By the great God of Heaven! It was not
  My serious meaning, it was ne'er resolve.
  I but amused myself with thinking of it.
  The free-will tempted me, the power to do
  Or not to do it.--Was it criminal
  To make the fancy minister to hope,
  To fill the air with pretty toys of air,
  And clutch fantastic sceptres moving t'ward me?
  Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not
  The road of duty clear beside me--but
  One little step and once more I was in it!
  Where am I? Whither have I been transported?
  No road, no track behind one, but a wall,
  Impenetrable, insurmountable,
  Rises obedient to the spells I muttered
  And meant not--my own doings tower behind me.

SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.
