    Who was it built the cradle of wrought gold?
    A druid, chanting by the waters old.
    Who was it kept the sword of vision bright?
    A warrior, falling darkly in the fight.
    Who was it put the crown upon the dove?
    A woman, paling in the arms of love.
    Oh, who but these, since Adam ceased to be,
    Have kept their ancient guard about the Tree?
