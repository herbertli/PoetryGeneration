COMING.

[April, 1861.]


  World, art thou 'ware of a storm?
    Hark to the ominous sound;
  How the far-off gales their battle form,
    And the great sea-swells feel ground!

  It comes, the Typhoon of Death--
    Nearer and nearer it comes!
  The horizon thunder of cannon-breath
    And the roar of angry drums!

  Hurtle, Terror sublime!
    Swoop o'er the Land to-day--
  So the mist of wrong and crime,
  The breath of our Evil Time
    Be swept, as by fire, away!

HENRY HOWARD BROWNELL.
