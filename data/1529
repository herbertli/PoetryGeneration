  When, at God's fiat, Light flashed forth, the beam
      Evolved a million pigments, as it sped
      To every nature. Now, of all its spread,
  What shaft so glorious as the poet's dream
  Which, mote and mass, reflects the Will Supreme
      That life is progress, and by flight, or tread,
      It circles God-ward up, till perfected!
  For, harboring meaner thought were to blaspheme.

  What, if the world be chaos where it sins,
      Race feuds, Creed hatreds, falsehoods gross, deceit,
      Intrigue and greed, form swirling, blinding sleet?
  Honor and Truth, though buried to their chins,
  Look up and smile; for, though the storms still beat,
      The poets show 'tis Spring, not Winter, wins.
