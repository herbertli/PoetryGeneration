LIFE.

    FROM "FESTUS," SCENE "A COUNTRY TOWN."


  FESTUS.--                      Oh! there is
  A life to come, or all's a dream.

  LUCIFER.--                         And all
  May be a dream. Thou seest in thine, men, deeds,
  Clear, moving, full of speech and order; then
  Why may not all this world be but a dream
  Of God's? Fear not! Some morning God may waken.

  FESTUS.--I would it were. This life's a mystery.
  The value of a thought cannot be told;
  But it is clearly worth a thousand lives
  Like many men's. And yet men love to live
  As if mere life were worth their living for.
  What but perdition will it be to most?
  Life's more than breath and the quick round of blood;
  It is a great spirit and a busy heart.
  The coward and the small in soul scarce do live.
  One generous feeling--one great thought--one deed
  Of good, ere night, would make life longer seem
  Than if each year might number a thousand days,
  Spent as is this by nations of mankind.
  We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;
  In feelings, not in figures on a dial.
  We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives
  Who thinks most--feels the noblest--acts the best.
  Life's but a means unto an end--that end
  Beginning, mean, and end to all things--God.

PHILIP JAMES BAILEY.
