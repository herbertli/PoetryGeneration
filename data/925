THE PROSPECT.


  Methinks we do as fretful children do,
    Leaning their faces on the window-pane
    To sigh the glass dim with their own breath's stain,
  And shut the sky and landscape from their view;
  And, thus, alas! since God the maker drew
    A mystic separation 'twixt those twain,--
    The life beyond us and our souls in pain,--
  We miss the prospect which we are called unto
  By grief we are fools to use. Be still and strong,
  O man, my brother! hold thy sobbing breath,
    And keep thy soul's large windows pure from wrong;
  That so, as life's appointment issueth,
    Thy vision may be clear to watch along
  The sunset consummation-lights of death.

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.
