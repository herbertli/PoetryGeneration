HEAVEN.


  O beauteous God! uncircumscrib?treasure
  Of an eternal pleasure!
  Thy throne is seated far
  Above the highest star,
  Where thou preparest a glorious place,
  Within the brightness of thy face,
  For every spirit
  To inherit
  That builds his hopes upon thy merit,
  And loves thee with a holy charity.
  What ravished heart, seraphic tongue, or eyes
  Clear as the morning rise,
  Can speak, or think, or see
  That bright eternity,
  Where the great King's transparent throne
  Is of an entire jasper stone?
  There the eye
  O' the chrysolite,
  And a sky
  Of diamonds, rubies, chrysoprase,--
  And above all thy holy face,--
  Makes an eternal charity.
  When thou thy jewels up dost bind, that day
  Remember us, we pray,--
  That where the beryl lies,
  And the crystal 'bove the skies,
  There thou mayest appoint us place
  Within the brightness of thy face,--
  And our soul
  In the scroll
  Of life and blissfulness enroll,
  That we may praise thee to eternity. Allelujah!

JEREMY TAYLOR.
