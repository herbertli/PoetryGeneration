  Is it Apocalyptic Vision, when
      White-winged Columbus swoops from Spain's palmed shore
      And, from dark depths, lifts at San Salvador,
  A continent, adrip with streams which, then,
  Become the fountain of the Psalmist's ken,
      Where Right the heart, from hoof to horn foam-hoar
      From craggy speed, slakes thirst, and, evermore,
  Comes Hope's whole clattering herd?--you chant, "Amen."

  Aye, for your sires made earth this new creation
      Where, from San Salvadore and Plymouth Reef
      To Westward Mission Trails, ascends belief
  In God and, therefore, in the Soul's Salvation
  Through Freedom, in white, spiral spray which grief
      Sees, spite earth-mists, or solar obscuration.
