  What is it that today we celebrate
      With school recital, banquet and parade
      Of our achievements, pageanting each trade?
  The ousting of the English--train and trait--
  And posting, then, sharp-eyed, eternal hate
      To watch with Josuah's son above his head,
      That night come not to help them re-invade,
  However wide, we swing our ocean gate.

  If not un-Englishing America in mind
      And heart forever, vain the shrieks
      Of Freedom, eagling back to dawn's first streaks.
  Oh, yea, the sun stands, and the night afar
      Holds Thrall, whose craft would swamp our noblest peaks
      And leave but bubbling mud show where they are!
