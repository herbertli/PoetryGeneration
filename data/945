EDWIN AND PAULINUS:

    THE CONVERSION OF NORTHUMBRIA.


  The black-haired gaunt Paulinus
    By ruddy Edwin stood:--
  "Bow down, O king of Deira,
    Before the blessed Rood!
  Cast out thy heathen idols.
    And worship Christ our Lord."
  --But Edwin looked and pondered,
    And answered not a word.

  Again the gaunt Paulinus
    To ruddy Edwin spake:
  "God offers life immortal
    For his dear Son's own sake!
  Wilt thou not hear his message,
    Who bears the keys and sword?"
  --But Edwin looked and pondered,
    And answered not a word.

  Rose then a sage old warrior
    Was fivescore winters old;
  Whose beard from chin to girdle
    Like one long snow-wreath rolled:
  "At Yule-time in our chamber
    We sit in warmth and light,
  While cold and howling round us
    Lies the black land of Night.

  "Athwart the room a sparrow
    Darts from the open door:
  Within the happy hearth-light
    One red flash,--and no more!
  We see it come from darkness,
    And into darkness go:--
  So is our life. King Edwin!
    Alas, that it is so!

  "But if this pale Paulinus
    Have somewhat more to tell;
  Some news of Whence and Whither,
    And where the soul will dwell;--
  If on that outer darkness
    The sun of hope may shine;--
  He makes life worth the living!
    I take his God for mine!"

  So spake the wise old warrior;
    And all about him cried,
  "Paulinus' God hath conquered!
    And he shall be our guide:--
  For he makes life worth living
    Who brings this message plain,
  When our brief days are over,
    That we shall live again."
