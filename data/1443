  Say, what is Ma-jest-y without externals?
      Is Burke's analysis not right--"A Jest"?
      Ah, but a jest, at which the poor, oft pressed
  To their last heart-drop, laugh not, like court journals.
  The King needs coin, and, where he sowed no kernels,
      Wants the whole forest for his hawks to nest
      And breed in, and became an annual pest;
  In this the farmers show that they discern ills.

  Hark! blares the tyrant's horn and, in a thrice,
      The Tories gather. Eagerly they band,
      For is the King not greater than the land?
  And rows with royalty, a rabble's vice?
      Besides, what creeping tribes at his command,
      And Spies and Hessians at a ferret's price!
