AMAZING, BEAUTEOUS CHANGE!


  Amazing, beauteous change!
  A world created new!
  My thoughts with transport range,
  The lovely scene to view;
      In all I trace,
      Saviour divine,
      The word is thine,--
      Be thine the praise!

  See crystal fountains play
  Amidst the burning sands;
  The river's winding way
  Shines through the thirsty lands;
      New grass is seen,
      And o'er the meads
      Its carpet spreads
      Of living green.

  Where pointed brambles grew,
  Intwined with horrid thorn,
  Gay flowers, forever new,
  The painted fields adorn,--
      The blushing rose
      And lily there,
      In union fair,
      Their sweets disclose.

  Where the bleak mountain stood
  All bare and disarrayed,
  See the wide-branching wood
  Diffuse its grateful shade;
      Tall cedars nod,
      And oaks and pines,
      And elms and vines
      Confess thee God.

  The tyrants of the plain
  Their savage chase give o'er,--
  No more they rend the slain,
  And thirst for blood no more;
      But infant hands
      Fierce tigers stroke,
      And lions yoke
      In flowery bands.

  O, when, Almighty Lord!
  Shall these glad things arise,
  To verify thy word,
  And bless our wandering eyes?
      That earth may raise,
      With all its tongues,
      United songs
      Of ardent praise.

PHILIP DODDRIDGE.
