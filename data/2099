    Until at length the sudden grief that shook
      His pierc?bosom like a gust is past,
    And laid full weary on the wide-spread book,
      His eyes grow dim with slumber light and fast;
    But scarcely have his dreams had time to look
      On lands of kindlier promise, when aghast
    He starts up softly, and in wondering wise
    Listens atremble with wide open eyes.
