UP HILL.


  Does the road wind up hill all the way?
    _Yes, to the very end._
  Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
    _From morn to night, my friend_.

  But is there for the night a resting-place?
    _A roof for when the slow dark hours begin._
  May not the darkness hide it from my face?
    _You cannot miss that inn_.

  Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
    _Those who have gone before._
  Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
    _They will not keep you standing at that door_.

  Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
    _Of labor you shall find the sum._
  Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
    _Yea, beds for all who come_.
