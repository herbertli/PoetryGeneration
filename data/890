  By all means use sometimes to be alone.
  Salute thyself: see what thy soul doth wear.
  Dare to look in thy chest; for 't is thine own;
  And tumble up and down what thou find'st there.
    Who cannot rest till he good fellows finde,
    He breaks up house, turns out of doores his minde.

  In clothes, cheap handsomenesse doth bear the bell.
  Wisdome's a trimmer thing than shop e'er gave.
  Say not then, This with that lace will do well;
  But, This with my discretion will be brave.
    Much curiousnesse is a perpetual wooing;
    Nothing, with labor; folly, long a doing.
