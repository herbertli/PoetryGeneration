    And ere the shadow of another night
      Hath darkened Pisa, many a foe shall stray
    Through Nino's home, with eyes malignly bright
      In wolfish quest, but shall not find his prey:
    The while those lovers in their white-winged flight
      Shall see far out upon the twilight grey,
    Behind, the glimmer of the sea, before,
      The dusky outlines of a kindlier shore.
