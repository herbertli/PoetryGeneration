      'My Nino, my sweet Nino!' and no more
    She said, but fluttered like a bird and fell
      Lifeless as marble to the footworn floor;
    And there she lies even now in lonely cell,
      Poor lady, pale with all the grief she bore,
    She could not live, and still be true to thee,
    And so she's gone where no rude hands can be."
