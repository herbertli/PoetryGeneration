  Wordless the night-wind, funereal plumes of the tree-tops swaying--
    Writhing and nodding anon at the beck of the unseen breeze!
  Yet its voice ever a murmur resumes, as of multitudes praying:
    Liturgies lost in a moan like the mourning of far-away seas.
  May then those spirits, set free, a celestial council obeying,
    Move in this rustling whisper here thro' the dark, shaken trees?--
  Souls that are voices alone to us, now, yet linger, returning
    Thrilled with a sweet reconcilement and fervid with speechless desire?
  Sundered in warfare, immortal they meet now with wonder and yearning,
    Dwelling together united, a rapt, invisible choir:
  Hearken! They wail for the living, whose passion of battle, yet burning,
  Sears and enfolds them in coils, and consumes, like a serpent of fire!
