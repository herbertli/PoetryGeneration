  O heart and brain, who see the father load
      His train with food, not for the few, but all,
      And hear train-whistlings in March winds, jay call
  And ground-hog sniffs! Haste out, for from the road
  That leads to every Industry's abode,
      The trust that, bat-eyed, comes out at night-fall,
      Now moves the tracks inside his private wall,
  Claiming all trains from God a debt long owed.

  O heart and brain, it rest with you, how long
      The legislative wreckers shall prevail.
      Ye have the power to balk them. Why then, fail?
  Regain your legislatures. Man them strong
  And drive thence all sleek hounds, trust-trained to trail
      Safe outlaws' paths to fastnesses of wrong.
