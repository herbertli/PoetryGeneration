ALL.


  There hangs a sabre, and there a rein,
  With a rusty buckle and green curb chain;
  A pair of spurs on the old gray wall,
  And a mouldy saddle--well, that is all.

  Come out to the stable--it is not far;
  The moss grown door is hanging ajar.
  Look within! There's an empty stall,
  Where once stood a charger, and that is all.

  The good black horse came riderless home,
  Flecked with blood drops as well as foam;
  See yonder hillock where dead leaves fall;
  The good black horse pined to death--that's all.

  All? O, God! it is all I can speak.
  Question me not--I am old and weak;
  His sabre and his saddle hang on the wall,
  And his horse pined to death--I have told you all.

FRANCIS ALEXANDER DURIVAGE.
