HUMILITY.


  The bird that soars on highest wing
    Builds on the ground her lowly nest;
  And she that doth most sweetly sing
    Sings in the shade, where all things rest;
  In lark and nightingale we see
  What honor hath humility.

  When Mary chose "the better part,"
    She meekly sat at Jesus' feet;
  And Lydia's gently opened heart
    Was made for God's own temple meet:
  Fairest and best adorned is she
  Whose clothing is humility.

  The saint that wears heaven's brightest crown,
    In deepest adoration bends:
  The weight of glory bows him down
    Then most, when most his soul ascends:
  Nearest the throne itself must be
  The footstool of humility.

JAMES MONTGOMERY.
