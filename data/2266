 From upland slopes I see the cows file by,
 Lowing, great-chested, down the homeward trail,
 By dusking fields and meadows shining pale
 With moon-tipped dandelions. Flickering high,
 A peevish night-hawk in the western sky
 Beats up into the lucent solitudes,
 Or drops with griding wing. The stilly woods
 Grow dark and deep and gloom mysteriously.
 Cool night-winds creep, and whisper in mine ear
 The homely cricket gossips at my feet.
 From far-off pools and wastes of reeds I hear,
 Clear and soft-piped, the chanting frogs break sweet
 In full Pandean chorus. One by one
 Shine out the stars, and the great night comes on.
