  There are two darknesses; one where the Lord
      Hides beauty--that by which men know His face.
      All, in that darkness, feel His fingers trace
  Their features gently, and their hearts record
  The feeling, as of one, whose eyes, restored,
      Would see, but for the Father's close embrace.
      The other is the outer dark--a place
  Where hate turns black the light upon it poured.

  O God! the only darkness that I dread,
      Is where Thou art not--that where Hate's black fire
      Surmounts the heavens, to burst with thunder dire
  And, in its fall forever, drag the dead
  Of heart and spirit--those whom Thy desire
      Would fain have made the halo round Thy head.
