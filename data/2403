  "Too young am I, too tender,
    To bear earth's avalanche
  Of wrong, that grinds down life-hope,
    And makes my heart's-blood blanch.

  "Tell him who soon shall follow
    Where my tired feet have bled,
  He must be older, shrewder,
    Hard, cold, and selfish-bred--

  "Or else like me be trampled
    Under the harsh world's heel.
   'Tis weakness to be youthful;
    'Tis death to love and feel."
