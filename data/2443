  Do you remember, my sweet, absent son,
  How in the soft June days forever done
  You loved the heavens so warm and clear and high;
  And when I lifted you, soft came your cry,--
  "Put me 'way up--'way, 'way up in blue sky"?

  I laughed and said I could not;--set you down,
  Your gray eyes wonder-filled beneath that crown
  Of bright hair gladdening me as you raced by.
  Another Father now, more strong than I,
  Has borne you voiceless to your dear blue sky.
