  Religion is Ascension. 'Tis the flights
      Of souls to summits of the true and wise.
      One, witnessing the generations rise,
  Sees them a shine at countless, different heights,
  Where they, responding to their inner lights,
      Glow, like the clouds at morn, with graded dyes.
      If summits, there are depths; if virtue, vice;
  Hence, 'tis life's rise from falls, that judgment sights.

  Witnessed, or not, there is no age, nor climb,
      But souls arise as bloom, where earth is treed;
      As warm, red rays, where cold from mountaining need;
  As burst and spread of planets, where dark crime;
  Nay, rise to poise above the star's top speed
      To God, like larks, in praise for life and time.
