WHERE ARE THE MEN?


  Where are the men who went forth in the morning,
    Hope brightly beaming in every face?
  Fearing no danger,--the Saxon foe scorning,--
    Little thought they of defeat or disgrace!
  Fallen is their chieftain--his glory departed--
    Fallen are the heroes who fought by his side!
  Fatherless children now weep, broken-hearted,
    Mournfully wandering by Rhuddlan's dark tide!

  Small was the band that escaped from the slaughter,
    Flying for life as the tide 'gan to flow;
  Hast thou no pity, thou dark rolling water?
    More cruel still than the merciless foe!
  Death is behind them, and death is before them;
    Faster and faster rolls on the dark wave;
  One wailing cry--and the sea closes o'er them;
    Silent and deep is their watery grave.

From the Welsh of TALIESSIN,
