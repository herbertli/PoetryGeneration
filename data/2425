  We were alone: the perfumed night,
    Moonlighted, like a flower
  Grew round us and exhaled delight
    To bless that one sweet hour.

  You stood where, 'mid the white and gold,
    The rose-fire through the gloom
  Touched hair and cheek and garment's fold
    With soft, ethereal bloom.

  And when the vision seemed to swerve,
    'T was but the flickering shine
  That gave new grace, a lovelier curve,
    To every dream-like line.

  O perfect vision! Form and face
    Of womanhood complete!
  O rare ideal to embrace
    And hold, from head to feet!

  Could I so hold you ever--could
    Your eye still catch the glow
  Of mine--it were an endless good:
    Together we should grow

  One perfect picture of our love!...
    Alas, the embers old
  Fell, and the moonlight fell, above--
    Dim, shattered, vapor-cold.
