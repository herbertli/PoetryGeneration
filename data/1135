THE KING TO HIS SOLDIERS BEFORE HARFLEUR.

[1415.]

FROM "KING HENRY V.," ACT III. SC. 1.


    Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
  Or close the wall up with our English dead!
  In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
  As modest stillness, and humility:
  But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
  Then imitate the action of the tiger;
  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage:
  Then lend the eye a terrible asp?;
  Let it pry through the portage of the head,
  Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it,
  As fearfully as doth a gall?rock
  O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
  Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
  Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide;
  Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
  To his full height!--On, on, you noblest English,
  Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
  Fathers, that, like so many Alexanders,
  Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought,
  And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
  Dishonor not your mothers; now attest,
  That those whom you called fathers, did beget you!
  Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
  And teach them how to war!--And you, good yeomen,
  Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
  The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
  That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not;
  For there is none of you so mean and base,
  That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot;
  Follow your spirit: and, upon this charge,
  Cry--God for Harry! England! and Saint George!

SHAKESPEARE.
