THE CALL.


  Come, my way, my truth, my life--
    Such a way as gives us breath;
  Such a truth as ends all strife;
    Such a life as killeth death.

  Come my light, my feast, my strength--
    Such a light as shows a feast;
  Such a feast as mends in length;
    Such a strength as makes His guest.

  Come my joy, my love, my heart!
    Such a joy as none can move;
  Such a love as none can part;
    Such a heart as joys in love.

GEORGE HERBERT.
