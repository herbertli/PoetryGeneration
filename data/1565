  In English nature, did Saint George prevail
      Over the Dragon? Maybe in the time
      When England knew not poverty, nor crime,
  Described by Cobbett, who would not go bail
  For falsehood, nor let truth remain in jail.
      It must, then, have renewed life from its slime,
      For, oh! through deeds, that turn the blood to chyme
  And eyes white inward, see him ride the gale.

  In English nature--oh, where now the saint--
      The spirit, to sublime conceptions, true?
      Has good Saint George, too woundful to renew
  His conflict with the dragon of base taint,
  Been caught up by Elias from earth's view?
      How, else, the dragon's rage in irrestraint?
