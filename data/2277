 We have not heard the music of the spheres,
 The song of star to star, but there are sounds
 More deep than human joy and human tears,
 That Nature uses in her common rounds;
 The fall of streams, the cry of winds that strain
 The oak, the roaring of the sea's surge, might
 Of thunder breaking afar off, or rain
 That falls by minutes in the summer night.
 These are the voices of earth's secret soul,
 Uttering the mystery from which she came.
 To him who hears them grief beyond control,
 Or joy inscrutable without a name,
 Wakes in his heart thoughts bedded there, impearled,
 Before the birth and making of the world.
