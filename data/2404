  Then saw I how the New Year
    Came like a scheming man,
  With icy eyes, his forehead
    Wrinkled by care and plan

  For trade and rule and profit.
    To him the fading child
  Looked up and cried, "Oh, brother!"
    But died even while it smiled.

  Down bent the harsh new-comer
    To lift with loving arm
  The wanderer mute and fallen;
    And lo! his eyes were warm;

  All changed he grew; the wrinkles
    Vanished: he, too, looked young--
  As if that lost child's spirit
    Into his breast had sprung.

  So are those lives not wasted,
    Too frail to bear the fray.
  So Years may die, yet leave us
    Young hearts in a world grown gray.
