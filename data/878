DIFFERENT MINDS.


  Some murmur when their sky is clear
    And wholly bright to view,
  If one small speck of dark appear
    In their great heaven of blue;
  And some with thankful love are filled
    If but one streak of light,
  One ray of God's good mercy, gild
    The darkness of their night.

  In palaces are hearts that ask,
    In discontent and pride,
  Why life is such a dreary task,
    And all good things denied;
  And hearts in poorest huts admire
    How Love has in their aid
  (Love that not ever seems to tire)
    Such rich provision made.
