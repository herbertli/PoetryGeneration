    In Nino's chamber not a sound intrudes
      Upon the midnight's tingling silentness,
    Where Nino sits before his book and broods,
      Thin and brow-burdened with some fine distress,
    Some gloom that hangs about his mournful moods
      His weary bearing and neglected dress:
    So sad he sits, nor ever turns a leaf--
    Sorrow's pale miser o'er his hoard of grief.
