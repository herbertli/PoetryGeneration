  The wounded Sidney, who despite his thirst,
      Gave water to his comrade, shines, a lamp
      In the Cimerian dark of Britain's camp.
  Even the Raleigh, who so finely versed,
  Preferred to such a light, the flame accursed
      Of sword and torch, to please a royal vamp.
      Is British triumph in its world-wide tramp
  The Hell, still "lower than lowest"--Milton's worst?

  Lord Christ! is British soldiery the swine,
      In whose gross forms the fiends, exercised, flew?
      Oh! watch them through the ages, they pursue
  The noble and devour all things Divine.
  Look! they illustrate horrors, which prove true
      The Hell, which Milton's glimpse could not outline.
