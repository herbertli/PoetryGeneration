  I sing, with a voice too low
    To be heard beyond to-day,
  In minor keys of my people's woe;
    And my songs pass away.

  To-morrow hears them not--
    To-morrow belongs to fame:
  My songs--like the birds'--will be forgot,
    And forgotten shall be my name.

  And yet who knows! betimes
    The grandest songs depart,
  While the gentle, humble, and low-toned rhymes
    Will echo from heart to heart.

ABRAM JOSEPH RYAN.
