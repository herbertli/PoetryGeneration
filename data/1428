  Oh, ever Mothers--shaping robust youth
      No less than infant, and as perfectly!
      There's life blood to their veins from when on knee
  To when thy battle, from your broadening ruth
  For Human kind and fervent love of truth.
      If, like their fathers, they have come to be
      The wonder of the world, for liberty,
  Your virtue, 'tis, that in their valor greweth.

  Oh, as the Roman Mother, when she showed
      For jewels, her two sons, saw each of them
      In Time's Tiara, glittering there a gem;
  So, see your offspring shine. The light, bestowed
  Your Fathers, in your sons is diamond flame,
      Encircling Freedom's ocean-walled abode.
