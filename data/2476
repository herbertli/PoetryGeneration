    Victors, living, with laureled brow,
      And you that sleep beneath the sward!
    Your song was poured from cannon throats:
    It rang in deep-tongued bugle-notes:
    Your triumph came; you won your crown,
    The grandeur of a world's renown.
          But, in our later lays,
          Full freighted with your praise,
  Fair memory harbors those whose lives, laid down
        In gallant faith and generous heat,
          Gained only sharp defeat.
  All are at peace, who once so fiercely warred:
  Brother and brother, now, we chant a common chord.
