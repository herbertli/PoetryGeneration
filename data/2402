  "Dying of hunger and sorrow:
    I die for my youth I fear!"
  Murmured the midnight-haunting
    Voice of the stricken Year.

  There like a child it perished
    In the stormy thoroughfare:
  The snow with cruel whiteness
    Had aged its flowing hair.

  Ah, little Year so fruitful,
    Ah, child that brought us bliss,
  Must we so early lose you--
    Our dear hopes end in this?
