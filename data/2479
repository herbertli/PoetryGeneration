      Mute Seminary there,
  Filled once with resonant hymn and prayer,
  How your meek walls and windows shuddered then!
      Though Doubleday stemmed the flood,
    McPherson's Wood and Willoughby's Run
        Saw ere the set of sun
      The light of the gospel of blood.
      And, on the morrow again,
    Loud the unholy psalm of battle
      Burst from the tortured Devil's Den,
    In cries of men and musketry rattle
    Mixed with the helpless bellow of cattle
      Torn by artillery, down in the glen;
        While, hurtling through the branches
        Of the orchard by the road,
     Where Sickles and Birney were walled with steel,
        Shot fiery avalanches
    That shivered hope and made the sturdiest reel.
    Yet peach-bloom bright as April saw
     Blushed there anew, in blood that flowed
    O'er faces white with death-dealt awe;
     And ruddy flowers of warfare grew,
  Though withering winds as of the desert blew,
    Far at the right while Ewell and Early,
      Plunging at Slocum and Wadsworth and Greene,
    Thundered in onslaught consummate and surly;
      Till trembling nightfall crept between
  And whispered of rest from the heat of the whelming strife.
        But unto those forsaken of life
        What has the night to say?
    Silent beneath the moony sky,
    Crushed in a costly dew they lie:
    Deaf to plaint or paean, they:--
    Freed from Earth's dull tyranny.
