    And still with questions vain he probes his grief,
      Till thought is wearied out, and dreams grow dim.
    What bitter chance, what woe beyond belief
      Could keep his lady's heart so hid from him?
    Or was her love indeed but light and brief,
      A passing thought, a moment's dreamy whim?
    Aye there it stings, the woe that never sleeps:
    Poor Nino leans upon his book, and weeps.
