    The moments passed as at a play,
    I had the wisdom love can bring,
    I had my share of mother wit;
    And yet for all that I could say,
    And though I had her praise for it,
    And she seemed happy as a king,
    Love's moon was withering away.

    Believing every word I said
    I praised her body and her mind,
    Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,
    And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,
    And vanity her footfall light;
    Yet we, for all that praise, could find
    Nothing but darkness overhead.

    I sat as silent as a stone
    And knew, though she'd not said a word,
    That even the best of love must die,
    And had been savagely undone
    Were it not that love, upon the cry
    Of a most ridiculous little bird,
    Threw up in the air his marvellous moon.

                         _William Butler Yeats_
