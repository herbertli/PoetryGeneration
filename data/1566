  The dragon is grim greed. The Saint's long spear,
      That once transfixed it, can no longer touch.
      No land is safe from its sting, blood-drain, or clutch--
  For it takes Protean shapes; 'tis, therefore, clear,
  Since good Saint George has failed to re-appear
      To mortal sight, save in the King's escutch--
      Worn off at edge and blurred with Tudor smudge--
  Freedom must drive the Dragon off this sphere.

  The Dragon's soarings cause the sun's eclypse.--
      Hark! is that thunder, God's collapsing skys?
      No; 'tis the Eagle, with un-hooded eyes
  And lightening flash from beak to pinion tips,
  Seizing the Dragon that, despite its slips
      From form to form--craft, gold and false sunrise--
      Can not elude his eye and talon grips.
