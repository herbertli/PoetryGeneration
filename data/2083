    Once idly in his hall king Olave sat
      Pondering, and with his dagger whittled chips;
      And one drew near to him with austere lips,
    Saying, "To-morrow is Monday," and at that
    The king said nothing, but held forth his flat
      Broad palm, and bending on his mighty hips,
      Took up and mutely laid thereon the slips
    Of scattered wood, as on a hearth, and gat
    From off the embers near, a burning brand.
      Kindling the pile with this, the dreaming Dane
    Sat silent with his eyes set and his bland
      Proud mouth, tight-woven, smiling, drawn with pain,
      Watching the fierce fire flare, and wax, and wane,
    Hiss and burn down upon his shrivelled hand.
