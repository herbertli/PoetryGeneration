    The wind-swayed daisies, that on every side
      Throng the wide fields in whispering companies,
      Serene and gently smiling like the eyes
    Of tender children long beatified,
    The delicate thought-wrapped buttercups that glide
      Like sparks of fire above the wavering grass,
      And swing and toss with all the airs that pass,
    Yet seem so peaceful, so preoccupied;

    These are the emblems of pure pleasures flown,
      I scarce can think of pleasure without these.
    Even to dream of them is to disown
      The cold forlorn midwinter reveries,
    Lulled with the perfume of old hopes new-blown,
      No longer dreams, but dear realities.
