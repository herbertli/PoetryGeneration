    Lovely to look on, O South,
      No longer stately-scornful
    But beautiful still in pride,
  Our hearts go out to you as toward a bride!
        Garmented soft in white,
  Haughty, and yet how love-imbuing and tender!
  You stand before us with your gently mournful
  Memory-haunted eyes and flower-like mouth,
    Where clinging thoughts--as bees a-cluster
    Murmur through the leafy gloom,
      Musical in monotone--
    Whisper sadly. Yet a lustre
    As of glowing gold-gray light
      Shines upon the orient bloom,
      Sweet with orange-blossoms, thrown
    Round the jasmine-starred, deep night
    Crowning with dark hair your brow.
    Ruthless, once, we came to slay,
      And you met us then with hate.
    Rough was the wooing of war: we won you,
      Won you at last, though late!
        Dear South, to-day,
    As our country's altar made us
      One forever, so we vow
    Unto yours our love to render:
    Strength with strength we here endow,
    And we make your honor ours.
  Happiness and hope shall sun you:
  All the wiles that half betrayed us
    Vanish from us like spent showers.
