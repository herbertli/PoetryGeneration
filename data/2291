 I love the warm bare earth and all
   That works and dreams thereon:
 I love the seasons yet to fall:
   I love the ages gone,

 The valleys with the sheeted grain,
   The river's smiling might,
 The merry wind, the rustling rain,
   The vastness of the night.

 I love the morning's flame, the steep
   Where down the vapour clings:
 I love the clouds that float and sleep,
   And every bird that sings.

 I love the purple shower that pours
   On far-off fields at even:
 I love the pine-wood dusk whose floors
   Are like the courts of heaven.

 I love the heaven's azure span,
   The grass beneath my feet:
 I love the face of every man
   Whose thought is swift and sweet.

 I let the wrangling world go by,
   And like an idle breath
 Its echoes and its phantoms fly:
   I care no jot for death.

 Time like a Titan bright and strong
   Spreads one enchanted gleam:
 Each hour is but a fluted song,
   And life a lofty dream.
