A LANCASHIRE DOXOLOGY.

    "Some cotton has lately been imported into Farringdon, where
    the mills have been closed for a considerable time. The
    people, who were previously in the deepest distress, went out
    to meet the cotton: the women wept over the bales and kissed
    them, and finally sang the Doxology over them."--_Spectator_
    of May 14, 1803.


  "Praise God from whom all blessings flow,"
  Praise him who sendeth joy and woe.
  The Lord who takes, the Lord who gives,
  O, praise him, all that dies, and lives.

  He opens and he shuts his hand,
  But why we cannot understand:
  Pours and dries up his mercies' flood,
  And yet is still All-perfect Good.

  We fathom not the mighty plan,
  The mystery of God and man;
  We women, when afflictions come,
  We only suffer and are dumb.

  And when, the tempest passing by,
  He gleams out, sunlike through our sky,
  We look up, and through black clouds riven
  We recognize the smile of Heaven.

  Ours is no wisdom of the wise,
  We have no deep philosophies;
  Childlike we take both kiss and rod,
  For he who loveth knoweth God.

DINAH M. MULOCK CRAIK.
