MATTER AND MAN IMMORTAL.

    FROM "NIGHT THOUGHTS," NIGHT VI.


  As in a wheel, all sinks, to reascend:
  Emblems of man, who passes, not expires.
    With this minute distinction, emblems just,
  Nature revolves, but man advances; both
  Eternal, that a circle, this a line.
  That gravitates, this soars. Th' aspiring soul,
  Ardent, and tremulous, like flame, ascends,
  Zeal and humility her wings, to Heaven.
  The world of matter, with its various forms,
  All dies into new life. Life born from death
  Rolls the vast mass, and shall for ever roll.
  No single atom, once in being, lost,
  With change of counsel charges the Most High.
    What hence infers Lorenzo? Can it be?
  Matter immortal? And shall spirit die?
  Above the nobler, shall less noble rise?
  Shall man alone, for whom all else revives,
  No resurrection know? Shall man alone,
  Imperial man! be sown in barren ground,
  Less privileged than grain, on which he feeds?
