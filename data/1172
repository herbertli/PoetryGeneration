THE COUNTERSIGN.


  Alas the weary hours pass slow,
    The night is very dark and still,
  And in the marshes far below
    I hear the bearded whippoorwill.
  I scarce can see a yard ahead;
    My ears are strained to catch each sound;
  I hear the leaves about me shed,
    And the spring's bubbling through the ground.

  Along the beaten path I pace,
    Where white rags mark my sentry's track;
  In formless shrubs I seem to trace
    The foeman's form, with bending back;
  I think I see him crouching low--
    I stop and list--I stoop and peer,
  Until the neighboring hillocks grow
    To groups of soldiers far and near.

  With ready piece I wait and watch,
    Until my eyes, familiar grown,
  Detect each harmless earthen notch,
    And turn guerrillas into stone;
  And then amid the lonely gloom,
    Beneath the tall old chestnut trees,
  My silent marches I resume,
    And think of other times than these.

  "Halt! who goes there?" my challenge cry,
    It rings along the watchful line;
  "Relief!" I hear a voice reply--
    "Advance, and give the countersign!"
  With bayonet at the charge I wait--
    The corporal gives the mystic spell;
  With arms aport I charge my mate,
    Then onward pass, and all is well.

  But in the tent that night awake,
    I ask, if in the fray I fall,
  Can I the mystic answer make,
    When the angelic sentries call?
  And pray that Heaven may so ordain,
    Where'er I go, what fate be mine,
  Whether in pleasure or in pain,
    I still may have the countersign.
