    One wept, whose only babe was dead,
        New-born ten years ago.
    "Weep not; he is in bliss," they said.
        She answered, "Even so.

    "Ten years ago was born in pain
        A child, not now forlorn;
    But oh, ten years ago in vain
        A mother, a mother was born."

                         _Alice Meynell_
