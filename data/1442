  Of Expeditions in the Arctic Past,
      All honor to the one that reached the pole
      And formed a settlement where every soul
  Enjoyed full freedom. There above the blast,
  How musical the bell, by Justice cast!
      It welcomed all to come. It ceased to toll
      After a while, but why? Those, welcomed, stole
  And dragged it where the ice formed thick and fast.

  Of Arctic Expeditions there is none
      So profitable to the human race
      As that toward Freedom's pole, and hence men face
  All storms to reach it. If they fail, the sun
      Has but one joy--to thaw out wrecks, and trace
      Man's progress where alone it can be done.
