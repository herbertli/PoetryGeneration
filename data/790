O MASTER, LET ME WALK WITH THEE.


  O Master, let me walk with thee
  In lowly paths of service free;
  Tell me thy secret; help me bear
  The strain of toil, the fret of care;
  Help me the slow of heart to move
  By some clear winning word of love;
  Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
  And guide them in the homeward way.

  O Master, let me walk with thee
  Before the taunting Pharisee;
  Help me to bear the sting of spite,
  The hate of men who hide thy light,
  The sore distrust of souls sincere
  Who cannot read thy judgments clear,
  The dulness of the multitude
  Who dimly guess that thou art good.

  Teach me thy patience; still with thee
  In closer, dearer company,
  In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
  In trust that triumphs over wrong,
  In hope that sends a shining ray
  Far down the future's broadening way,
  In peace that only thou canst give,
  With thee, O Master, let me live!

WASHINGTON GLADDEN.
