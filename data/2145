    Or whether sad or joyous be her hours,
      Yet ever is she good and ever fair.
      If she be glad, 'tis like a child's wild air,
    Who claps her hands above a heap of flowers;
    And if she's sad, it is no cloud that lowers,
      Rather a saint's pale grace, whose golden hair
      Gleams like a crown, whose eyes are like a prayer
    From some quiet window under minster towers.

    But ah, Beloved, how shall I be taught
      To tell this truth in any rhymed line?
    For words and woven phrases fall to naught,
      Lost in the silence of one dream divine,
    Wrapped in the beating wonder of this thought:
      Even thou, who art so precious, thou art mine!
