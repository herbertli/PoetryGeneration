THE HIGHER GOOD.


  Father, I will not ask for wealth or fame,
    Though once they would have joyed my carnal sense:
  I shudder not to bear a hated name,
    Wanting all wealth, myself my sole defence.
  But give me, Lord, eyes to behold the truth;
    A seeing sense that knows the eternal right;
  A heart with pity filled, and gentlest ruth;
    A manly faith that makes all darkness light:
  Give me the power to labor for mankind;
    Make me the mouth of such as cannot speak;
  Eyes let me be to groping men, and blind;
    A conscience to the base; and to the weak
  Let me be hands and feet; and to the foolish, mind;
  And lead still further on such as thy kingdom seek.

THEODORE PARKER.
