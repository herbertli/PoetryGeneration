AT GIBRALTAR.


  I.

  England, I stand on thy imperial ground
    Not all a stranger; as thy bugles blow,
    I feel within my blood old battles flow,--
  The blood whose ancient founts are in thee found
  Still surging dark against the Christian bound
    While Islam presses; well its peoples know
    Thy heights that watch them wandering below:
  I think how Lucknow heard their gathering sound.

  I turn and meet the cruel, turbaned face.
    England! 'tis sweet to be so much thy son!
  I feel the conqueror in my blood and race;
    Last night Trafalgar awed me, and to-day
  Gibraltar wakened; hark, thy evening gun
    Startles the desert over Africa.


  II.

  Thou art the rock of empire set mid-seas
    Between the East and West, that God has built;
    Advance thy Roman borders where thou wilt,
  While run thy armies true with his decrees;
  Law, justice, liberty,--great gifts are these.
    Watch that they spread where English blood is spilt,
    Lest, mixed and sullied with his country's guilt
  The soldier's life-stream flow, and Heaven displease!

  Two swords there are: one naked, apt to smite,
    Thy blade of war; and, battle-storied, one
  Rejoices in the sheath, and hides from light.
    American I am; would wars were done!
  Now westward, look, my country bids good night,--
    Peace to the world, from ports without a gun!

GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY.
