  _He won her love; and so this opal sings
  With all its tints in maze, that seem to quake
  And leap in light, as if its heart would break:_

  Gleam of the sea,
  Translucent air,
  Where every leaf alive with glee
  Glows in the sun without shadow of grief--
  You speak of spring,
  When earth takes wing
  And sunlight, sunlight is everywhere!
  Radiant life,
  Face so fair--
  Crowned with the gracious glory of wife--
  Your glance lights all this happy day,
  Your tender glow
  And murmurs low
  Make miracle, miracle, everywhere.

  Earth takes wing
  With birds--do I care
  Whether of sorrow or joy they sing?
  No; for they make not my life nor destroy!
  My soul awakes
  At a smile that breaks
  In sun; and sunlight is everywhere!
