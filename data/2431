  I did not know before
    That we dead could rise and walk;
  That our voices, as of yore,
    Would blend in gentle talk.

  I did not know her eyes
    Would so haunt mine after death,
  Or that she could hear my sighs,
    Low as the harp-string's breath.

  But, ah, last night we met!
    From our stilly trance we rose,
  Thrilled with all the old regret--
    The grieving that God knows.

  She asked: "Am I forgiven?"--
    "And dost thou forgive?" I said,
  Ah! how long for joy we'd striven!
    But now our hearts were dead.

  Alas, for the lips I kissed
    And the sweet hope, long ago!
  On her grave chill hangs the mist;
    On mine, white lies the snow.
