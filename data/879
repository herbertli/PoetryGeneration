MY RECOVERY.


  Recovery,--daughter of Creation too,
  Though not for immortality designed,--
      The Lord of life and death
      Sent thee from heaven to me!
  Had I not heard thy gentle tread approach,
  Not heard the whisper of thy welcome voice,
      Death had with iron foot
      My chilly forehead pressed.
  'Tis true, I then had wandered where the earths
  Roll around suns; had strayed along the paths
      Where the maned comet soars
      Beyond the arm?eye;
  And with the rapturous, eager greet had hailed
  The inmates of those earths and of those suns;
      Had hailed the countless host
      That throng the comet's disc;
  Had asked the novice questions, and obtained
  Such answers as a sage vouchsafes to youth;
      Had learned in hours far more
      Than ages here unfold!
  But I had then not ended here below
  What, in the enterprising bloom of life,
      Fate with no light behest
      Required me to begin.
  Recovery,--daughter of Creation too,
  Though not for immortality designed,--
      The Lord of life and death
      Sent thee from heaven to me!

From the German of FRIEDRICH GOTTLIEB KLOPSTOCK.
