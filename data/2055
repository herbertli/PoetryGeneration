    And slowly as we heard you, day by day,
      The stillness of enchanted reveries
      Bound brain and spirit and half-clos?eyes,
    In some divine sweet wonder-dream astray;
    To us no sorrow or upreared dismay
      Nor any discord came, but evermore
      The voices of mankind, the outer roar,
    Grew strange and murmurous, faint and far away.

    Morning and noon and midnight exquisitely,
      Wrapt with your voices, this alone we knew,
    Cities might change and fall, and men might die,
      Secure were we, content to dream with you,
        That change and pain are shadows faint and fleet,
        And dreams are real, and life is only sweet.
