    O many-toned rain!
  O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
  How welcome is its delicate overture
  At evening, when the moist and glowing west
  Seals all things with cool promise of night's rest.

    At first it would allure
  The earth to kinder mood,
  With dainty flattering
  Of soft, sweet pattering:
  Faintly now you hear the tramp
  Of the fine drops, falling damp
  On the dry, sun-seasoned ground
  And the thirsty leaves, resound.
  But anon, imbued
  With a sudden, bounding access
  Of passion, it relaxes
  All timider persuasion.
  And, with nor pretext nor occasion,
  Its wooing redoubles;
  And pounds the ground, and bubbles
  In sputtering spray,
  Flinging itself in a fury
  Of flashing white away;
  Till the dusty road,
  Dank-perfumed, is o'erflowed;
  And the grass, and the wide-hung trees,
  The vines, the flowers in their beds,--
  The virid corn that to the breeze
  Rustles along the garden-rows,--
  Visibly lift their heads,
  And, as the quick shower wilder grows,
  Upleap with answering kisses to the rain.

    Then, the slow and pleasant murmur
  Of its subsiding,
  As the pulse of the storm beats firmer,
  And the steady rain
  Drops into a cadenced chiding!
  Deep-breathing rain,
  The sad and ghostly noise
  Wherewith thou dost complain---
  Thy plaintive, spiritual voice,
  Heard thus at close of day
  Through vaults of twilight gray--
  Vexes me with sweet pain;
  And still my soul is fain
  To know the secret of that yearning
  Which in thine utterance I hear returning.
  Hush, oh hush!
  Break not the dreamy rush
  Of the rain:
  Touch not the marring doubt
  Words bring to the certainty
  Of its soft refrain;
  But let the flying fringes flout
  Their drops against the pane,
  And the gurgling throat of the water-spout
  Groan in the eaves amain.

  The earth is wedded to the shower;
  Darkness and awe gird round the bridal hour!
