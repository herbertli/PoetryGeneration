LIVING WATERS.


  There are some hearts like wells, green-mossed and deep
        As ever Summer saw;
  And cool their water is,--yea, cool and sweet;--
        But you must come to draw.
  They hoard not, yet they rest in calm content,
        And not unsought will give;
  They can be quiet with their wealth unspent,
        So self-contained they live.

  And there are some like springs, that bubbling burst
        To follow dusty ways,
  And run with offered cup to quench his thirst
        Where the tired traveller strays;
  That never ask the meadows if they want
        What is their joy to give;--
  Unasked, their lives to other life they grant,
        So self-bestowed they live!

  And One is like the ocean, deep and wide,
        Wherein all waters fall;
  That girdles the broad earth, and draws the tide,
        Feeding and bearing all;
  That broods the mists, that sends the clouds abroad,
        That takes, again to give;--
  Even the great and loving heart of God.
        Whereby all love doth live.

CAROLINE S. SPENCER.
