SELECTIONS FROM PARADISE LOST.


  BOOK I.

  THE POET'S THEME.

  Of man's first disobedience and the fruit
  Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
  Brought death into the world and all our woe,

  And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark
  Illumine, what is low raise and support;
  That to the height of this great argument
  I may assert eternal Providence,
  And justify the ways of God to men.

  'Twixt day and night, and now from end to end
  Night's hemisphere had veiled the horizon round:
  When Satan, who late fled before the threats
  Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved
  In meditated fraud and malice, bent
  On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap
  Of heavier on himself, fearless returned.
  By night he fled, and at midnight returned
  From compassing the Earth;
