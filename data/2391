  They crossed the hills; they came to where
  Through an arid gloom the river Chaudiere
  Fled like a Maenad with outstreaming hair;
  And there the soldier sank, and died.
  Death-dumb he fell; yet ere life sped,
  Child-like on her knee he laid his head.
  She strove to pray; but all words fled
  Save those their love had sanctified.

  And then her voice rose waveringly
  To the notes of a mother's lullaby;
  But her song was only "Ah, must thou die?"
  And to her his eyes death-still replied.
