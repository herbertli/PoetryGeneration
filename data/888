A TRUE LENT.


  Is this a fast,--to keep
    The larder lean,
      And clean
  From fat of veals and sheep?

  Is it to quit the dish
    Of flesh, yet still
      To fill
  The platter high with fish?

  Is it to fast an hour.
    Or ragg'd to go,
      Or show
  A downcast look, and sour?

  No! 't is a fast to dole
    Thy sheaf of wheat,
      And meat,
  Unto the hungry soul.

  It is to fast from strife,
    From old debate
      And hate,--
  To circumcise thy life.

  To show a heart grief-rent;
    To starve thy sin,
      Not bin,--
  And that's to keep thy Lent.

ROBERT HERRICK.
