      Rough men, who dragged her to a dungeon deep,
    Where many a weary soul in darkness pent
      For many a year had watched the slow days creep,
    And there he left her for his dark intent,
      Where madness breeds and sorrows never sleep.
    Coarse robes he gave her, and her lips he fed
    With bitter water and a crust of bread.
