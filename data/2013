Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon,
Gathering daisies
  In the meadows of Doone,
Hears a shrill piping,
  Elflike and free,
Where the waters go brawling
  In rills to the sea;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon,
Through the green grasses
  Peeps softly; and soon
Spies under green willows
  A fairy whose song
Like the smallest of bubbles
  Floats bobbing along;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Her cheeks were like wine,
Her eyes in her wee face
  Like water-sparks shine,
Her niminy fingers
  Her sleep tresses preen,
The which in the combing
  She peeps out between;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Shrill, shrill was her tune:--
"Come to my water-house,
  Annie Maroon:
Come in your dimity,
  Ribbon on head,
To wear siller seaweed
  And coral instead";
    Singing down-adown-derry.

"Down-adown-derry,
  Lean fish of the sea,
Bring lanthorns for feasting
  The gay Fa?e;
'Tis sand for the dancing,
  A music all sweet
In the water-green gloaming
  For thistledown feet";
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon
Looked large on the fairy
  Curled wan as the moon;
And all the grey ripples
  To the Mill racing by,
With harps and with timbrels
  Did ringing reply;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

"Down-adown-derry,"
  Sang the Fairy of Doone,
Piercing the heart
  Of sweet Annie Maroon;
And lo! when like roses
  The clouds of the sun
Faded at dusk, gone
  Was Annie Maroon;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  The daisies are few;
Frost twinkles powdery
  In haunts of the dew;
And only the robin
  Perched on a thorn,
Can comfort the heart
  Of a father forlorn;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  There's snow in the air;
Ice where the lily
  Bloomed waxen and fair;
He may call o'er the water,
  Cry--cry through the Mill,
But Annie Maroon, alas!
  Answer ne'er will;
    Singing down-adown-derry.
