    FOUND IN HIS BIBLE IN THE GATE-HOUSE AT WESTMINSTER.


  E'en such is time; that takes in trust
    Our youth, our joys, our all we have,
  And pays us but with earth and dust;
  Who in the dark and silent grave,
  When we have wandered all our ways,
  Shuts up the story of our days:
  But from this earth, this grave, this dust,
  My God shall raise me up, I trust.

SIR WALTER RALEIGH.
