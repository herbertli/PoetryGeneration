    "Dost see these cheeks, my Nino? they're so thin,
      Not round and soft, as when thou touched them last:
    So long with bitter rage they pent me in,
      Like some poor thief in lonely dungeon cast;
    Only this night through every bolt and gin
      By cunning stealth I wrought my way at last.
    Straight to thine heart I fled, unfaltering,
    Like homeward pigeon with uncag?wing.
