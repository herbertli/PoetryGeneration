    All the day long, wherever pools might be
      Among the golden meadows, where the air
      Stood in a dream, as it were moor?there
    Forever in a noon-tide reverie,
    Or where the birds made riot of their glee
      In the still woods, and the hot sun shone down,
      Crossed with warm lucent shadows on the brown
    Leaf-paven pools, that bubbled dreamily,

    Or far away in whispering river meads
      And watery marshes where the brooding noon,
      Full with the wonder of its own sweet boon,
    Nestled and slept among the noiseless reeds,
      Ye sat and murmured, motionless as they,
      With eyes that dreamed beyond the night and day.
