  Pass on, O steps, with your dead, sad note!
    For a people's homage is in the sound;
  And the even tread, in measured rote,
    As a leader is laid beneath the ground,
      Rumors the hum of a pilgrim train
      That shall trample the earth as tramples the rain,
      Seeking the door of the hero's tomb,
      Seeking him where he lies low in the gloom,
      Paying him tribute of worker and mage,
      Through age on age!
