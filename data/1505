  What is the Truth? The thought, the act, or cry,
      Recasting the Supreme Intelligence;
      All else is false. Look! where are stars so dense,
  That each has not the freedom of the sky?
  And, still, what peace, what glory, reigns on high!
      What! with the wisdom of the heavens, dispense?
      The Peace, for which our longings grow intense,
  Comes through the stars to earth, and but thereby.

  What splits dark mid-night and gives earth a thrill?
      All stars merged into one--our Country's aim.
      It is a lightening, formed by God, to flame
  Across the ages and flash bolts to kill
  The stranglers, who the heart or spirit, main,
      Or choke black in the face, a People's Will.
