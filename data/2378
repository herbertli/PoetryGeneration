  Thou art my morning, twilight, noon, and eve,
    My summer and my winter, spring and fall;
    For Nature left on thee a touch of all
  The moods that come to gladden or to grieve
    The heart of Time, with purpose to relieve
    From lagging sameness. So do these forestall
    In thee such o'erheaped sweetnesses as pall
  Too swiftly, and the taster tasteless leave.

  Scenes that I love to me always remain
    Beautiful, whether under summer sun
  Beheld, or, storm-dark, stricken across with rain.
    So, through all humors, thou 'rt the same sweet one:
  Doubt not I love thee well in each, who see
  Thy constant change is changeful constancy.
