 There came no change from week to week
   On all the land, but all one way,
 Like ghosts that cannot touch nor speak,
       Day followed day.

 Within the palace court the rounds
   Of glare and shadow, day and night,
 Went ever with the same dull sounds,
       The same dull flight:

 The motion of slow forms of state,
   The far-off murmur of the street,
 The din of couriers at the gate,
       Half-mad with heat;

 Sometimes a distant shout of boys
   At play upon the terrace walk,
 The shutting of great doors, and noise
       Of muttered talk.

 In one red corner of the wall,
   That fronted with its granite stain
 The town, the palms, and, beyond all,
       The burning plain,

 As listless as the hour, alone,
   The poet by his broken lute
 Sat like a figure in the stone,
       Dark-browed and mute.

 He saw the heat on the thin grass
   Fall till it withered joint by joint,
 The shadow on the dial pass
       From point to point.

 He saw the midnight bright and bare
   Fill with its quietude of stars
 The silence that no human prayer
       Attains or mars.

 He heard the hours divide, and still
   The sentry on the outer wall
 Make the night wearier with his shrill
       Monotonous call.

 He watched the lizard where it lay,
   Impassive as the watcher's face;
 And only once in the long day
       It changed its place.

 Sometimes with clank of hoofs and cries
   The noon through all its trance was stirred;
 The poet sat with half-shut eyes,
       Nor saw, nor heard.

 And once across the heated close
   Light laughter in a silver shower
 Fell from fair lips: the poet rose
       And cursed the hour.

 Men paled and sickened; half in fear,
   There came to him at dusk of eve
 One who but murmured in his ear
       And plucked his sleeve:

 'The king is filled with irks, distressed,
   And bids thee hasten to his side;
 For thou alone canst give him rest.'
       The poet cried:

 'Go, show the king this broken lute!
   Even as it is, so am I!
 The tree is perished to its root,
       The fountain dry.

 'What seeks he of the leafless tree,
   The broken lute, the empty spring?
 Yea, tho' he give his crown to me,
       I cannot sing!'
