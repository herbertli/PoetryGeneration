CAVALRY SONG.

  Our bugles sound gayly. To horse and away!
  And over the mountains breaks the day;
  Then ho! brothers, ho! for the ride or the fight,
  There are deeds to be done ere we slumber to-night!
    _And whether we fight or whether we fall
       By sabre-stroke or rifle-ball,
       The hearts of the free will remember us yet,
       And our country, our country will never forget!_

  Then mount and away! let the coward delight
  To be lazy all day and safe all night;
  Our joy is a charger, flecked with foam,
  And the earth is our bed and the saddle our home!
    _And whether we fight,_ etc.

  See yonder the ranks of the traitorous foe,
  And bright in the sunshine bayonets glow!
  Breathe a prayer, but no sigh; think for what you would fight;
  Then charge! with a will, boys, and God for the right!
    _And whether we fight_, etc.

  We have gathered again the red laurels of war;
  We have followed the traitors fast and far;
  But some who rose gayly this morn with the sun
  Lie bleeding and pale on the field they have won!
  _But whether we fight or whether we fall
  By sabre-stroke or rifle-ball,
  The hearts of the free will remember us yet,
  And our country, our country will never forget_!
