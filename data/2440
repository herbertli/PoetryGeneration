    When the leaves, by thousands thinned,
  A thousand times have whirled in the wind,
  And the moon, with hollow cheek,
  Staring from her hollow height,
  Consolation seems to seek
  From the dim, reechoing night;
  And the fog-streaks dead and white
  Lie like ghosts of lost delight
  O'er highest earth and lowest sky;
  Then, Autumn, work thy witchery!

    Strew the ground with poppy-seeds,
  And let my bed be hung with weeds,
  Growing gaunt and rank and tall,
  Drooping o'er me like a pall.
  Send thy stealthy, white-eyed mist
  Across my brow to turn and twist
  Fold on fold, and leave me blind
  To all save visions in the mind.
  Then, in the depth of rain-fed streams
  I shall slumber, and in dreams
  Slide through some long glen that burns
  With a crust of blood-red ferns
  And brown-withered wings of brake
  Like a burning lava-lake;--
  So, urged to fearful, faster flow
  By the awful gasp, "Hahk! hahk!" of the crow,
  Shall pass by many a haunted rood
  Of the nutty, odorous wood;
  Or, where the hemlocks lean and loom,
  Shall fill my heart with bitter gloom;
  Till, lured by light, reflected cloud,
  I burst aloft my watery shroud,
  And upward through the ether sail
  Far above the shrill wind's wail;--
  But, falling thence, my soul involve
  With the dust dead flowers dissolve;
  And, gliding out at last to sea,
  Lulled to a long tranquillity,
  The perfect poise of seasons keep
  With the tides that rest at neap.
  So must be fulfilled the rite
  That giveth me the dead year's might;
  And at dawn I shall arise
  A spirit, though with human eyes,
  A human form and human face;
  And where'er I go or stay,
  There the summer's perished grace
  Shall be with me, night and day.
