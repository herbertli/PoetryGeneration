STONEWALL JACKSON'S WAY


  Come, stack arms, men; pile on the rails;
    Stir up the camp-fire bright!
  No growling if the canteen fails:
    We'll make a roaring night.
  Here Shenandoah brawls along,
  There burly Blue Ridge echoes strong,
  To swell the Brigade's rousing song,
    Of Stonewall Jackson's Way.

  We see him now--the queer slouched hat,
    Cocked o'er his eye askew;
  The shrewd, dry smile; the speech so pat,
    So calm, so blunt, so true.
  The "Blue-light Elder" knows 'em well:
  Says he, "That's Banks; he's fond of shell.--
  Lord save his soul! we'll give him--;" Well,
    That's Stonewall Jackson's Way.

  Silence! Ground arms! Kneel all! Caps off!
    Old Massa's going to pray.
  Strangle the fool that dares to scoff:
    Attention!--it's his way.
  Appealing from his native sod,
  _In forma pauperis_ to God.
  "Lay bare Thine arm! Stretch forth Thy rod:
    Amen!"--That's Stonewall's Way.

  He's in the saddle now. Fall in!
    Steady! the whole brigade.
  Hill's at the ford, cut off; we'll win
    His way out, ball and blade.
  What matter if our shoes are worn?
  What matter if our feet are torn?
  Quick step! we're with him before morn:
    That's Stonewall Jackson's Way.

  The sun's bright lances rout the mists
    Of morning; and--By George!
  Here's Longstreet, struggling in the lists,
    Hemmed in an ugly gorge.
  Pope and his Dutchmen!--whipped before.
  "Bay'nets and grape!" hear Stonewall roar.
  Charge, Stuart! Pay off Ashby's score,
    In Stonewall Jackson's Way.

  Ah, Maiden! wait and watch and yearn
    For news of Stonewall's band.
  Ah, Widow! read, with eyes that burn,
    That ring upon thy hand.
  Ah, Wife! sew on, pray on, hope on!
  Thy life shall not be all forlorn.
  The foe had better ne'er been born,
    That gets in Stonewall's Way.
