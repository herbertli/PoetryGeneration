  Soft-throated South, breathing of summer's ease
    (Sweet breath, whereof the violet's life is made!)
    Through lips moist-warm, as thou hadst lately stayed
  'Mong rosebuds, wooing to the cheeks of these
  Loth blushes faint and maidenly:--rich breeze,
    Still doth thy honeyed blowing bring a shade
    Of sad foreboding. In thy hand is laid
  The power to build or blight the fruit of trees,
  The deep, cool grass, and field of thick-combed grain.

  Even so my Love may bring me joy or woe,
    Both measureless, but either counted gain
  Since given by her. For pain and pleasure flow
    Like tides upon us of the self-same sea.
    Tears are the gems of joy and misery.
