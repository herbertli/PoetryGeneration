  Look Nature through, 'tis neat gradation all.
  By what minute degrees her scale ascends!
  Each middle nature joined at each extreme,
  To that above is joined, to that beneath;
  Parts, into parts reciprocally shot,
  Abhor divorce: what love of union reigns!
  Here, dormant matter waits a call to life;
  Half-life, half-death, joined there; here life and sense;
  There, sense from reason steals a glimmering ray;
  Reason shines out in man. But how preserved
  The chain unbroken upward, to the realms
  Of incorporeal life? those realms of bliss
  Where death hath no dominion? Grant a make
  Half-mortal, half-immortal; earthy, part,
  And part ethereal; grant the soul of man
  Eternal; or in man the series ends.
  Wide yawns the gap; connection is no more;
  Checked Reason halts; her next step wants support;
  Striving to climb, she tumbles from her scheme.

DR. EDWARD YOUNG.
