    And now with broken laughter on her lips,
      And now with moans remembering of her care,
    She weeps, and smiles, and like a child she slips
      Her lily fingers through his curly hair,
    The while her head with all it's sweet she dips,
      Close to his ear, to soothe and murmur there;
    "Oh, Nino, I was hid so long from thee,
    That much I doubted what thy love might be.
