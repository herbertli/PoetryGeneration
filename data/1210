ODE TO PEACE.


  Daughter of God! that sitt'st on high
  Amid the dances of the sky,
  And guidest with thy gentle sway
  The planets on their tuneful way;
    Sweet Peace! shall ne'er again
  The smile of thy most holy face,
  From thine ethereal dwelling-place,
  Rejoice the wretched, weary race
    Of discord-breathing men?
  Too long, O gladness-giving Queen!
  Thy tarrying in heaven has been;
  Too long o'er this fair blooming world
  The flag of blood has been unfurled,
    Polluting God's pure day;
  Whilst, as each maddening people reels,
  War onward drives his scythed wheels,
  And at his horses' bloody heels
    Shriek Murder and Dismay.

  Oft have I wept to hear the cry
  Of widow wailing bitterly;
  To see the parent's silent tear
  For children fallen beneath the spear;
    And I have felt so sore
  The sense of human guilt and woe,
  That I, in Virtue's passioned glow,
  Have cursed (my soul was wounded so)
    The shape of man I bore!
  Then come from thy serene abode,
  Thou gladness-giving child of God!
  And cease the world's ensanguined strife,
  And reconcile my soul to life;
    For much I long to see,
  Ere I shall to the grave descend,
  Thy hand its blessed branch extend,
  And to the world's remotest end
    Wave Love and Harmony!

WILLIAM TENNANT.
