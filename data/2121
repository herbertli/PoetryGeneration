    "'Oh father, God will never give thee rest,
      If thou be false to what thy lips have sworn,
    And false to love, and false to me distressed,
      A helpless maid, so broken and outworn.
    This cup--she put it softly to her breast--
      I pray thee carry, ere the morrow morn,
    To Nino's hand, and tell him all my pain;
    This other with mine own lips I will drain.'
