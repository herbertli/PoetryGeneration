    Oh city, whom grey stormy hands have sown
      With restless drift, scarce broken now of any,
      Out of the dark thy windows dim and many
    Gleam red across the storm. Sound is there none,
    Save evermore the fierce wind's sweep and moan,
      From whose grey hands the keen white snow is shaken
      In desperate gusts, that fitfully lull and waken,
    Dense as night's darkness round thy towers of stone.

    Darkling and strange art thou thus vexed and chidden;
      More dark and strange thy veil?agony,
    City of storm, in whose grey heart are hidden
      What stormier woes, what lives that groan and beat,
      Stern and thin-cheeked, against time's heavier sleet,
        Rude fates, hard hearts, and prisoning poverty.
