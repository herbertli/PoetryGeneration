  Why play with words? There never can be peace
      Till Ireland is set free. One might as well
      Expect the great Arch-angel rest in Hell
  And genuflect to Satan's blasphemies,
  As Erin's spirit that, for centuries,
      Has been aloft with God in virtue, sell,
      Like Esaw, her birthright, and not rebel,
  But to her home's invaders, bend her knees.

  Her spirit is no norbury Banshee--
      To wail and, then, to vanish. She will stand
      With lifted flambeau, lighted by the hand
  That lights the stars, till she again is free,
  Inspiring normal man in every land
      With love of Freedom, by her scorn of thee.
