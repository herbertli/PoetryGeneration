  Where flies our flag is Freedom's holy ground;
      There, it unfurls all benisons to Man.
      The twin of Spring, its spread unfolds God's plan
  Of human happiness, by setting bound
  To greed, lust, powers,--all colds,--that Right be crowned.
      Lo! where it leads, ye youth form valor's van,
      Mirrored and echoed by the azure's span
  For ages, for Man's gain in yours is wound.

  Oh, justice's Hot Gulf Stream are ye, who open
      The sea, which fiendish craft has frozen hard!
      Oh, may your warmth for righteousness transform
  The tyrant's artic region, with no hope in,
  To Freedom's Temperate Zone, which they, who guard
      The planets, save from wreck by quake or storm.
