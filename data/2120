    "'Alas, poor me! whom cruel hearts would wed
      On the sad morrow to that wicked lord;
    But I'll not go; nay, rather I'll be dead,
      Safe from their frown and from their bitter word.
    Without my Nino life indeed were sped;
      And sith we two can never more accord
    In this drear world, so weary and perplext,
    We'll die, and win sweet pleasure in the next.
