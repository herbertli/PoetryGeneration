THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE.


  O thou great Friend to all the sons of men,
    Who once appeared in humblest guise below,
  Sin to rebuke, to break the captive's chain,
    And call thy brethren forth from want and woe,--

  We look to thee! thy truth is still the Light
    Which guides the nations, groping on their way,
  Stumbling and falling in disastrous night,
    Yet hoping ever for the perfect day.

  Yes; thou art still the Life, thou art the Way
    The holiest know; Light, Life, the Way of heaven!

  And they who dearest hope and deepest pray,
    Toil by the Light, Life, Way, which thou hast given.

THEODORE PARKER.
