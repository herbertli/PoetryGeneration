  O Harvard of the Norton wreath of gold
      And pearled, Longfellow purple! wherefore frown?
      If Eliott is a speck upon your gown,
  It will wash off; it is no stain to hold,
  For you had let him go for being old.
      Your wisdom was confirmed when to the crown,
      A'gainst good folks who, like Elisha Brown,
  Fought for their homes, he gave his name's renown.

  Come, Agassiz! for, from the smallest bone,
      You reconstruct the creature, tongue to tail.
      Tell us what Eliott is. Phew! What! a Whale?
  No; tis the prehistoric monster, known
  As Tory, that devoured young Nathan Hale
      And, where it crawled, spread horror's crimson zone.
