    By silent forest and field and mossy stone,
      We come from the wooded hill, and we go to the sea.
    We labour, and sing sweet songs, but we never moan,
      For our mother, the sea, is calling us cheerily.
    We have heard her calling us many and many a day
    From the cool grey stones and the white sands far away.

      The way is long, and winding and slow is the track,
        The sharp rocks fret us, the eddies bring us delay,
      But we sing sweet songs to our mother, and answer her back;
        Gladly we answer our mother, sweetly repay.
    Oh, we hear, we hear her singing wherever we roam,
    Far, far away in the silence, calling us home.

      Poor mortal, your ears are dull, and you cannot hear;
        But we, we hear it, the breast of our mother abeat;
      Low, far away, sweet and solemn and clear,
        Under the hush of the night, under the noontide heat:
    And we sing sweet songs to our mother, for so we shall please her best,
    Songs of beauty and peace, freedom and infinite rest.

      We sing, and sing, through the grass and the stones and the reeds,
        And we never grow tired, though we journey ever and aye,
      Dreaming, and dreaming, wherever the long way leads,
        Of the far cool rocks and the rush of the wind and the spray.
    Under the sun and the stars we murmur and dance and are free,
    And we dream and dream of our mother, the width of the sheltering sea.
