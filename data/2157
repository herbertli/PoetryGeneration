    Oh deep-eyed brothers was there ever here,
      Or is there now, or shall there sometime be
      Harbour or any rest for such as we,
    Lone thin-cheeked mariners, that aye must steer
    Our whispering barks with such keen hope and fear
      Toward misty bournes across that coastless sea,
      Whose winds are songs that ever gust and flee,
    Whose shores are dreams that tower but come not near.

    Yet we perchance, for all that flesh and mind
      Of many ills be marked with many a trace,
    Shall find this life more sweet more strangely kind,
      Than they of that dim-hearted earthly race,
      Who creep firm-nailed upon the earth's hard face,
    And hear nor see not, being deaf and blind.
