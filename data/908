FRANKFORD'S SOLILOQUY.

    FROM "A WOMAN KILLED WITH KINDNESS"


  O God! O God! that it were possible
  To undo things done; to call back yesterday!
  That time could turn up his swift sandy glass,
  To untell the days, and to redeem these hours!
                 Or that the sun
  Could, rising from the West, draw his coach backward,--
  Take from the account of time so many minutes.
  Till he had all these seasons called again,
  These minutes and these actions done in them.

THOMAS HEYWOOD.
