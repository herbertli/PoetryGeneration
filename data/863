  "She fair, divinely fair, fit love for gods.
  Not terrible, though terror be in love
  And beauty, not approached by stronger hate.
  Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;
  The way which to her ruin now I tend."
    So spake the enemy of mankind, inclosed
  In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve
  Addressed his way: not with indented wave,
  Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,
  Circular base of rising folds, that towered
  Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head
  Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;
  With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect.
  Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass
  Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape
  And lovely; never since of serpent-kind
  Lovelier.
