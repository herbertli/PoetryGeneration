  A budding mouth and warm blue eyes;
  A laughing face; and laughing hair,--
     So ruddy was its rise
     From off that forehead fair;

  Frank fervor in whate'er she said,
  And a shy grace when she was still;
     A bright, elastic tread;
     Enthusiastic will;

  These wrought the magic of a maid
  As sweet and sad as the sun in spring;--
     Joyous, yet half-afraid
     Her joyousness to sing.
