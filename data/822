THE SABBATH MORNING.


  With silent awe I hail the sacred morn,
  That slowly wakes while all the fields are still!
  A soothing calm on every breeze is borne;
  A graver murmur gurgles from the rill;
  And echo answers softer from the hill;
  And sweeter sings the linnet from the thorn:
  The skylark warbles in a tone less shrill.
  Hail, light serene! hail, sacred Sabbath morn!
  The rooks float silent by in airy drove;
  The sun a placid yellow lustre throws;
  The gales that lately sighed along the grove
  Have hushed their downy wings in dead repose
  The hovering rack of clouds forgets to move,--
  So smiled that day when the first morn arose!

JOHN LEYDEN.
