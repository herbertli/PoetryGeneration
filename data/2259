 O differing human heart,
 Why is it that I tremble when thine eyes,
 Thy human eyes and beautiful human speech,
 Draw me, and stir within my soul
 That subtle ineradicable longing
 For tender comradeship?
 It is because I cannot all at once,
 Through the half-lights and phantom-haunted mists
 That separate and enshroud us life from life,
 Discern the nearness or the strangeness of thy paths
 Nor plumb thy depths.
 I am like one that comes alone at night
 To a strange stream, and by an unknown ford
 Stands, and for a moment yearns and shrinks,
 Being ignorant of the water, though so quiet it is,
 So softly murmurous,
 So silvered by the familiar moon.
