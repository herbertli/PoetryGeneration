  Once more the sun deploys his rays:
  Third in the trilogy of battle-days
    The awful Friday comes:
      A day of dread,
  That should have moved with slow, averted head
      And muffled feet,
  Knowing what streams of pure blood shed,
  What broken hearts and wounded lives must meet
    Its pitiless tread.
  At dawn, like monster mastiffs baying,
  Federal cannon, with a din affraying,
  Roused the old Stonewall brigade,
  That, eagerly and undismayed,
  Charged amain, to be repelled
    After four hours' bitter fighting,
    Forth and back, with bayonets biting;
  Where in after years, the wood--
  Flayed and bullet-riddled--stood
  A presence ghostly, grim and stark,
    With trees all withered, wasted, gray,
    The place of combat night and day
  Like marshaled skeletons to mark.
  Anon, a lull: the troops are spelled.
      No sound of guns or drums
      Disturbs the air.
  Only the insect-chorus faintly hums,
    Chirping around the patient, sleepless dead
  Scattered, or fallen in heaps all wildly spread;
  Forgotten fragments left in hurried flight;
    Forms that, a few hours since, were human creatures,
      Now blasted of their features,
      Or stamped with blank despair;
  Or with dumb faces smiling as for gladness,
      Though stricken by utter blight
  Of motionless, inert, and hopeless sadness.
  Fear you the naked horrors of a war?
  Then cherish peace, and take up arms no more.
      For, if you fight, you must
      Behold your brothers' dust
      Unpityingly ground down
    And mixed with blood and powder,
    To write the annals of renown
      That make a nation prouder!
