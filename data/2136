    And so he folds her softly with quick sighs,
      And both with murmurs warm and musical
    Talk and retalk, with dim or smiling eyes,
      Of old delights and sweeter days to fall:
    And yet not long, for, ere the starlit skies
      Grow pale above the city's eastern wall,
    They rise, with lips and happy hands withdrawn,
    And pass out softly into the dawn.
