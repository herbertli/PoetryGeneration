PRAISE.


  To write a verse or two is all the praise
          That I can raise;
      Mend my estate in any wayes,
          Thou shalt have more.

  I go to church; help me to wings, and I
          Will thither flie;
      Or, if I mount unto the skie,
          I will do more.

  Man is all weaknesse: there is no such thing
          As Prince or King:
      His arm is short; yet with a sling
          He may do more.

  A herb destilled, and drunk, may dwell next doore,
          On the same floore,
      To a brave soul: Exalt the poore,
          They can do more.

  O, raise me then! poore bees, that work all day,
          Sting my delay,
      Who have a work, as well as they,
          And much, much more.

GEORGE HERBERT.
