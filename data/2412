  "How shall we honor the man who creates?"
    Asked the Bedouin chief, the poet Antar;--
  "Who unto the truth flings open our gates,
    Or fashions new thoughts from the light of a star;
  Or forges with craft of his finger and brain
    Some marvelous weapon we copy in vain;
  Or chants to the winds a wild song that shall
      wander forever undying?

  "See! His reward is in envies and hates;
    In lips that deny, or in stabs that may kill."
  "Nay," said the smith; "for there's one here who waits
    Humbly to serve you with unmeasured skill,
  Sure that no utmost devotion can fail,
    Offered to _you_, nor unfriended assail
  The heart of the hero and poet Antar, whose
      fame is undying!"

  "Speak," said the chief. Then the smith: "O Antar,
    It is I who would serve you! I know, by the soul
  Of the poet within you, no envy can bar
    The stream of your gratitude,--once let it roll.
  Listen. The lightning, your camel that slew,
    _I_ caught, and wrought in this sword-blade for you;--
  Sword that no foe shall encounter unhurt, or
      depart from undying."

  Burst from the eyes of Antar a swift rain,--Gratitude's
    glittering drops,--as he threw
  One shining arm round the smith, like a chain.
    Closer the man to his bosom he drew;
  Thankful, caressing, with "Great is my debt."
   "Yea," said the smith, and his eyelids were wet:
  "I knew the sword Dham would unite me with
      you in an honor undying."

  "So?" asked the chief, as his thumb-point at will
    Silently over the sword's edge played.
  --"Ay!" said the smith, "but there's one thing, still:
    Who is the smiter, shall smite with this blade?"
  Jealous, their eyes met; and fury awoke.
    "_I_ am the smiter!" Antar cried. One stroke
  Rolled the smith's head from his neck, and gave
      him remembrance undying.

  "Seek now who may, no search will avail:
    No man the mate of this weapon shall own!"
  Yet, in his triumph, the chieftain made wail:
    "Slain is the craftsman, the one friend alone
  Able to honor the man who creates.
    I slew him--_I_, who am poet! O fates,
  Grant that the envious blade slaying artists shall
      make them undying!"
