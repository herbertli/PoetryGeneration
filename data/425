     Life! I know not what thou art,
     But know that thou and I must part;
     And when, or how, or where we met
     I own to me's a secret yet.

     Life! we've been long together
     Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;
     'Tis hard to part when friends are dear--
     Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear;
     --Then steal away, give little warning,
       Choose thine own time;
     Say not Good Night,--but in some brighter clime
       Bid me Good Morning.

     A L. BARBAULD.
