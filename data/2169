    How still it is here in the woods. The trees
      Stand motionless, as if they did not dare
      To stir, lest it should break the spell. The air
    Hangs quiet as spaces in a marble frieze.
    Even this little brook, that runs at ease,
      Whispering and gurgling in its knotted bed,
      Seems but to deepen with its curling thread
    Of sound the shadowy sun-pierced silences.

    Sometimes a hawk screams or a woodpecker
      Startles the stillness from its fix?mood
    With his loud careless tap. Sometimes I hear
        The dreamy white-throat from some far off tree
      Pipe slowly on the listening solitude
        His five pure notes succeeding pensively.
