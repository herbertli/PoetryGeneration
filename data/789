ASCRIPTION.


  O thou who hast beneath Thy hand
  The dark foundations of the land,--
  The motion of whose ordered thought
  An instant universe hath wrought,--

  Who hast within Thine equal heed
  The rolling sun, the ripening seed,
  The azure of the speedwell's eye.
  The vast solemnities of sky,--

  Who hear'st no less the feeble note
  Of one small bird's awakening throat,
  Than that unnamed, tremendous chord
  Arcturus sounds before his Lord,--

  More sweet to Thee than all acclaim
  Of storm and ocean, stars and flame,
  In favor more before Thy face
  Than pageantry of time and space.

  The worship and the service be
  Of him Thou madest most like Thee,--
  Who in his nostrils hath Thy breath,
  Whose spirit is the lord of death!

CHARLES G.D. ROBERTS.
