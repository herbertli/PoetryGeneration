    Beloved, those who moan of love's brief day
      Shall find but little grace with me, I guess,
      Who know too well this passion's tenderness
    To deem that it shall lightly pass away,
    A moment's interlude in life's dull play;
      Though many loves have lingered to distress,
      So shall not ours, sweet Lady, ne'ertheless,
    But deepen with us till both heads be grey.

    For perfect love is like a fair green plant,
      That fades not with its blossoms, but lives on,
    And gentle lovers shall not come to want,
      Though fancy with its first mad dream be gone;
    Sweet is the flower, whose radiant glory flies,
    But sweeter still the green that never dies.
