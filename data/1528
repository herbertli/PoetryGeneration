  A cataract of stars, which, with each fall
      Broadens and brightens, rapturing the sight
      Of angel hosts, that view it from the height
  Of knowledge of God's love for one and all
  His creatures--and not darkness to appal
      The spirit by the quench of every light,
      For which God grants it vision--is the night
  Of Life's strange mysteries, both great and small.

  Oh cataracts, beyond the angels' count,
      Pause and shine pendant over every deep
      Of heart, mind, spirit! Lo! how down they sweep
  To basic Good where, massing, they remount,
  Till, mid God's "Many Mansions," high they leap,
      Forming forever, joy's most splendent fount!
