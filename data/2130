    "Oh Nino, my sweet Nino! speak to me,
      Nor stand so strange, nor look so deathly pale.
    'Twas all to prove thy heart's deaf constancy
      I brought that cup and told that piteous tale.
    Ah! chains and cells and cruel treachery
      Are weak indeed when women's hearts assail.
    Art angry, Nino?" 'Tis no monk that cries,
    But sweet Leonora with her love-lit eyes.
