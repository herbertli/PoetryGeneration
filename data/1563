  A Dukedom, and not one the worse for wear,
      Has Sims well earned by service to the King.
      'Tis said at court, Howe's spirit following
  The ocean still, found Sims his natural heir
  And said: "Swap souls; and, that the swap be fair,
      Give me to boot, the bone of Freedom's wing,
      To make the skyey bird a hobbling thing
  In marshes, where the ignisfatus flare."

  The Eagle with his eye and pinion, trained
      For mateship with the sun, twitched at a sting.
      Amazed to find a "cootie" on his wing,
  And that the insect dreamed, it was ordained
  By race heredity to serve the King--
      He shook his plume and azured, unprofained.
