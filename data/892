BRIEFS.


    WATER TURNED INTO WINE.

  The conscious water saw its God and blushed.


    THE WIDOW'S MITES.

  Two mites, two drops, yet all her house and land,
  Fall from a steady heart, though trembling hand:
  The other's wanton wealth foams high, and brave;
  The other cast away, she only gave.


    "TWO WENT UP TO THE TEMPLE TO PRAY."

  Two went to pray? O, rather say,
  One went to brag, the other to pray;

  One stands up close and treads on high,
  Where the other dares not lend his eye;

  One nearer to God's altar trod,
  The other to the altar's God.

RICHARD CRASHAW.
