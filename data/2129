    And now the gleaming goblet hath scarce dyed
      His lips' thin pallor with its deathly red,
    When Nino starts in wonder, fearful-eyed,
      For, lo! the stranger with outstretch?head
    Springs at his face one soft and sudden stride,
      And from his hand the deadly cup hath sped,
    Dashed to the ground, and all it's seeded store
    Runs out like blood upon the marble floor.
