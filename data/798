HOPE.

    FROM "THE PLEASURES OF HOPE."[A]


  Unfading Hope! when life's last embers burn,
  When soul to soul, and dust to dust return!
  Heaven to thy charge resigns the awful hour!
  O, then thy kingdom comes! Immortal Power!
  What though each spark of earth-born rapture fly
  The quivering lip, pale cheek, and closing eye!
  Bright to the soul thy seraph hands convey
  The morning dream of life's eternal day,--
  Then, then, the triumph and the trance begin,
  And all the phoenix spirit burns within!
