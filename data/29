    Although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face
    And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
    Like some last courtier at a gipsy camping place
    Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.
    The lineaments, the heart that laughter has made sweet,
    These, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd
    Will gather and not know that through its very street
    Once walked a thing that seemed, as it were, a burning cloud.

                                       _William Butler Yeats_
