    From where I sit, I see the stars,
      And down the chilly floor
    The moon between the frozen bars
      Is glimmering dim and hoar.

    Without in many a peak?mound
      The glinting snowdrifts lie;
    There is no voice or living sound;
      The embers slowly die.

    Yet some wild thing is in mine ear;
      I hold my breath and hark;
    Out of the depth I seem to hear
      A crying in the dark:

    No sound of man or wife or child,
      No sound of beast that groans,
    Or of the wind that whistles wild,
      Or of the tree that moans:

    I know not what it is I hear;
      I bend my head and hark:
    I cannot drive it from mine ear,
      That crying in the dark.
