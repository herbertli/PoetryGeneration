  Your heart is not a traitor to your mind.
      Who, knowing innocence in danger, dares
      Not turn his eye, for fear of smirk, or stares,
  By other courts, is Justice's statue blind,
  That to the wall, not Bench, should be assigned.
      Oft, Precedent is Folly with gray hairs;
      So you, recalling Junius, heard the prayers
  Of friendless Stilow; then, what did you find?

  A fellow man doomed wrongfully to die
      A felon's death. If such was Stilow's fate,
      You saw, the felon would have been the State;
  Hence, turned from Precedent, demanding "Why?"
  Justice, asleep in marble, woke and straight
      Unroofed the courthouse to let down the sky.
