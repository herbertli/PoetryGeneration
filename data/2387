      So it was the march began,
        The march of Morgan's riflemen,
      Who like iron held the van
      In unhappy Arnold's plan
        To win Wolfe's daring fame again.
      With them, by her husband's side,
        Jemima Warner, nobly free,
      Moved more fair than when, a bride,
        One year since, she strove to hide
      The blush it was a joy to see.
