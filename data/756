THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.


  When, marshalled on the nightly plain,
    The glittering host bestud the sky,
  One star alone, of all the train,
    Can fix the sinner's wandering eye.

  Hark! hark! to God the chorus breaks,
    From every host, from every gem:
  But one alone the Saviour speaks,
    It is the Star of Bethlehem.

  Once on the raging seas I rode,
    The storm was loud, the night was dark,
  The ocean yawned, and rudely blowed
    The wind that tossed my foundering bark.

  Deep horror then my vitals froze,
    Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem;
  When suddenly a star arose,--
    It was the Star of Bethlehem.

  It was my guide, my light, my all,
    It bade my dark forebodings cease;
  And through the storm and dangers' thrall
    It led me to the port of peace.

  Now safely moored, my perils o'er,
    I'll sing, first in night's diadem,
  Forever and forevermore,
    The Star!--the Star of Bethlehem!

HENRY KIRKE WHITE.
