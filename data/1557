  All luminaries have one source, one trend.
      The stars that calm the sailor, long sea-swirled,
      And canopy fond lovers from the World,
  And those that lead the heart and spirit, blend.
  Lo, only in the things and thoughts that tend
      Toward Love's High Harmony, is truth unfurled;
      All else are lies, whence heart, soul, mind are hurled
  Back to the Right--to Progress without end.

  The stars all chant as one. My soaring song
      Catches their flame and these few sparks reach earth:
      "As soon the shells forget their Ocean birth,
  As men forget the Right, where they belong
  By reason and by soul of deathless worth;
      Address the God in man, wouldst thou grow strong."
