FROM THE RECESSES OF A LOWLY SPIRIT.


  From the recesses of a lowly spirit,
  Our humble prayer ascends; O Father! hear it.
  Upsoaring on the wings of awe and meekness,
    Forgive its weakness!

  We see thy hand,--it leads us, it supports us;
  We hear thy voice,--it counsels and it courts us;
  And then we turn away; and still thy kindness
    Forgives our blindness.

  O, how long-suffering, Lord! but thou delightest
  To win with love the wandering: thou invited,
  By smiles of mercy, not by frowns or terrors,
    Man from his errors.

  Father and Saviour! plant within each bosom
  The seeds of holiness, and bid them blossom
  In fragrance and in beauty bright and vernal,
    And spring eternal.

SIR JOHN BOWRING.
