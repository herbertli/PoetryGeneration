    "There is the gift I bring"; the stranger's head
      Turns to the cup that glitters at his side:
    "And now my tongue draws back for very dread,
      Unhappy youth, from what it must not hide.
    The saddest tale that ever lips have said;
      Yet thou must know how sweet Leonora died,
    A broken martyr for love's weary sake,
    And left this gift for thee to leave or take."
