THE WORD.


  O Word of God incarnate,
    O Wisdom from on high,
  O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
    O Light of our dark sky;
  We praise thee for the radiance
    That from the hallowed page,
  A lantern to our footsteps,
    Shines on from age to age.

  The Church from thee, her Master,
    Received the gift divine;
  And still that light she lifteth
    O'er all the earth to shine.
  It is the golden casket
    Where gems of truth are stored;
  It is the heaven-drawn picture
    Of, thee, the living Word.

  It floateth like a banner
    Before God's host unfurled;
  It shineth like a beacon
    Above the darkling world;
  It is the chart and compass
    That o'er life's surging sea,
  Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
    Still guide, O Christ, to thee.

  Oh, make thy Church, dear Saviour,
    A lamp of burnished gold,
  To bear before the nations
    Thy true light, as of old.
  Oh, teach thy wandering pilgrims
    By this their path to trace,
  Till, clouds and darkness ended,
    They see thee face to face.

WILLIAM WALSHAM HOW.
