CONSCIENCE AND REMORSE.


  "Good-bye," I said to my Conscience--
    "Good-bye for aye and aye;"
  And I put her hands off harshly,
    And turned my face away:
  And Conscience, smitten sorely,
    Returned not from that day.

  But a time came when my spirit
    Grew weary of its pace:
  And I cried, "Come back, my Conscience,
    I long to see thy face;"
  But Conscience cried, "I cannot,--
    Remorse sits in my place."
