  Was not humility the Earthward stair
      From highest Heaven, by which God came to men,
      To show the way aloft to human ken?
  Ah, by what other pass, are men to fare
  Through mist and cloud, except the path, aflare
      With his blest steps from Heaven, and up again?
      Steps, not from star to star, but fen to fen,
  That all might follow and not one despair!

  Oh, steps of Love! Could we reach with our eyes
      Their fulgence, we would shrink back with dismay;
      For, though 'tis through the world's contempt move they--
  Hark! How the hidden choirs of countless skies
  Chant at all heights: "Lo, God comes by this way,
      And makes world-wide, His stair to Paradise!"
