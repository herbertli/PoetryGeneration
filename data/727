THE LOVE OF GOD.


  Thou Grace Divine, encircling all,
    A soundless, shoreless sea!
  Wherein at last our souls must fall,
    O Love of God most free!

  When over dizzy heights we go,
    One soft hand blinds our eyes,
  The other leads us, safe and slow,
    O Love of God most wise!

  And though we turn us from thy face,
    And wander wide and long,
  Thou hold'st us still in thine embrace,
    O Love of God most strong!

  The saddened heart, the restless soul,
    The toil-worn frame and mind,
  Alike confess thy sweet control,
    O Love of God most kind!

  But not alone thy care we claim,
    Our wayward steps to win;
  We know thee by a dearer name,
    O Love of God within!

  And, filled and quickened by thy breath,
    Our souls are strong and free
  To rise o'er sin and fear and death,
    O Love of God, to thee!
