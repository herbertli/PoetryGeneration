  Once, blindness was a burning ship at sea,
      With panic-stricken souls on every deck.
      The flame blew inward on that awful wreck,
  Burning the hopes that make life glad and free.
  Ah! then, through thee, it was, Philanthropy,
      Who trains her searchlight on the smallest speck
      And Speed out boats, like horses, neck to neck,
  Reached the dark hulk and thrilled its crew with glee.

  The flame is quenched, that burned out heart and brain.
      The ship where woe was mute, is loud with joy.
      Hark! hear the cheer on board, and cry, "Ahoy!"
  As fast the sails are hoisted, and the main
  Tides back toward hope for every girl and boy,
      Who, else, might reach no star of night's whole train.
