 'Tis a land where no hurricane falls,
 But the infinite azure regards
 Its waters for ever, its walls
 Of granite, its limitless swards;
 Where the fens to their innermost pool
 With the chorus of May are aring,
 And the glades are wind-winnowed and cool
     With perpetual spring;

 Where folded and half withdrawn
 The delicate wind-flowers blow,
 And the bloodroot kindles at dawn
 Her spiritual taper of snow;
 Where the limits are met and spanned
 By a waste that no husbandman tills,
 And the earth-old pine forests stand
     In the hollows of hills.

 'Tis the land that our babies behold,
 Deep gazing when none are aware;
 And the great-hearted seers of old
 And the poets have known it, and there
 Made halt by the well-heads of truth
 On their difficult pilgrimage
 From the rose-ruddy gardens of youth
     To the summits of age.

 Now too, as of old, it is sweet
 With a presence remote and serene;
 Still its byways are pressed by the feet
 Of the mother immortal, its queen:
 The huntress whose tresses, flung free,
 And her fillets of gold, upon earth,
 They only have honour to see
     Who are dreamers from birth.

 In her calm and her beauty supreme,
 They have found her at dawn or at eve,
 By the marge of some motionless stream,
 Or where shadows rebuild or unweave
 In a murmurous alley of pine,
 Looking upward in silent surprise,
 A figure, slow-moving, divine,
     With inscrutable eyes.
