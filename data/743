TWO SAYINGS.


  Two sayings of the Holy Scriptures beat
  Like pulses in the Church's brow and breast;
  And by them we find rest in our unrest,
  And heart-deep in salt tears, do yet entreat
  God's fellowship, as if on heavenly seat.
  The first is _Jesus wept_, whereon is prest
  Full many a sobbing face that drops its best
  And sweetest waters on the record sweet:
  And one is, where the Christ denied and scorned
  _Looked upon Peter_. Oh, to render plain,
  By help of having loved a little and mourned,
  That look of sovran love and sovran pain
  Which he who could not sin yet suffered, turned
  On him who could reject but not sustain!

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.
