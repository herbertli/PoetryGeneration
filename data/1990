I had a silver buckle,
  I sewed it on my shoe,
And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
  I danced the evening through.

I had a bunch of cowslips,
  I hid them in a grot,
In case the elves should come by night
  And me remember not.

I had a yellow riband,
  I tied it in my hair,
That, walking in the garden,
  The birds might see it there.

I had a secret laughter,
  I laughed it near the wall:
Only the ivy and the wind
  May tell of it at all.
