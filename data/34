    Thou settest splendors in my sight, O Lord!
      It seems as tho' a deep-hued sunset falls
      Forever on these Cyclopean walls--
    These battlements where Titan hosts have warred,
    And hewn the world with devastating sword,
      And shook with trumpets the eternal halls
      Where seraphim lay hid by bloody palls
    And only Hell and Silence were adored.

    Lo! the abyss wherein great Satan's wings
      Might gender tempests, and his dragons' breath
        Fume up in pestilence. Beneath the sun
    Or starry outposts on terrestrial things,
      Is no such testimony unto Death
        Nor altars builded to Oblivion.

                                     _George Sterling_
