    Comfort the sorrowful with watchful eyes
      In silence, for the tongue cannot avail.
      Vex not his wounds with rhetoric, nor the stale
    Worn truths, that are but maddening mockeries
    To him whose grief outmasters all replies.
      Only watch near him gently; do but bring
      The piteous help of silent ministering,
    Watchful and tender. This alone is wise.

    So shall thy presence and thine every motion,
    The grateful knowledge of thy sad devotion
      Melt out the passionate hardness of his grief,
    And break the flood-gates of the pent-up soul.
    He shall bow down beneath thy mute control,
      And take thine hands, and weep, and find relief.
