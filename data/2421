    If, from a careless hold,
      One gem of these should fall,
    No power of art or gold
      Its wholeness could recall:
    The lustrous wonder dies
      In gleams of irised rain,
    As light fades out from the eyes
      When a soul is crushed by pain.
    Take heed that from your hold
      My love you do not cast:
    Dim, shattered, vapor-cold--
      That day would be its last.
