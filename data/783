PRAYER AND ANSWER.


  O God, I cannot walk the Way,--
  The thorns, the thirst, the darkness,
  And bleeding feet and aching heart!
  I hear the songs and revels of the throng,--
  They sneer upon my downcast face with scorn,--
  Yet, O my God, I _must_ and shall walk with Thee!

  O God, I cannot take the Truth!
  Far easier honeyed hopes and falsehoods fair,
  But Truth,--the Truth is stern and strong and awful.
  It ploughs my soul with ploughshares flaming hot--
  Yet give me Truth. I must have Truth, O God!

  O God, I cannot live the Life,--
  The flinging all to death that life may come;
  The surging of Thy Spirit in my heart
  In fire and flame will all consume me,--
  Yet, O my God, I cannot live without Thee!

  And as I agonized in dust and shame
  With tears and sighs in all the bitter prayer,
  I felt, as 't were, an arm that stole around me,
  And raised me to my feet.
  And at the touch, hope blossomed in my heart,
  And new-found strength in flood-tides thrilled and throbbed

  Through soul and limbs. I looked to see....
  O tender lordly Face!
  It was Himself,--_the Way, the Truth, the Life_!

OLIVER HUCKEL.
