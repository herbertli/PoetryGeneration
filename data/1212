DISARMAMENT.


  "Put up the sword!" the voice of Christ once more
  Speaks, in the pauses of the cannon's roar,
  O'er fields of corn by fiery sickles reaped
  And left dry ashes; over trenches heaped
  With nameless dead; o'er cities starving slow
  Under a rain of fire; through wards of woe
  Down which a groaning diapason runs
  From tortured brothers, husbands, lovers, sons
  Of desolate women in their far-off homes,
  Waiting to hear the step that never comes!
  O men and brothers! let that voice be heard.
  War fails, try peace; put up the useless sword!

  Fear not the end. There is a story told
  In Eastern tents, when autumn nights grow cold,
  And round the fire the Mongol shepherds sit
  With grave responses listening unto it:
  Once on the errands of his mercy bent,
  Buddha, the holy and benevolent,
  Met a fell monster, huge and fierce of look,
  Whose awful voice the hills and forests shook.

  "O son of peace!" the giant cried, "thy fate
  Is sealed at last, and love shall yield to hate."
  The unarmed Buddha looking, with no trace
  Of fear or anger, in the monster's face,
  In pity said, "Poor fiend, even thee I love."
  Lo! as he spake the sky-tall terror sank
  To hand-breadth size; the huge abhorrence shrank
  Into the form and fashion of a dove;
  And where the thunder of its rage was heard,
  Circling above him sweetly sang the bird:
  "Hate hath no harm for love," so ran the song,
  "And peace unweaponed conquers every wrong!"
