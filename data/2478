  Lucid, pure, and calm and blameless
    Dawned on Gettysburg the day
  That should make the spot, once fameless,
    Known to nations far away.
  Birds were caroling, and farmers
    Gladdened o'er their garnered hay,
  When the clank of gathering armors
    Broke the morning's peaceful sway;
  And the living lines of foemen
    Drawn o'er pasture, brook, and hill,
  Formed in figures weird of omen
    That should work with mystic will
  Measures of a direful magic--
    Shattering, maiming--and should fill
  Glades and gorges with a tragic
    Madness of desire to kill.
  Skirmishers flung lightly forward
    Moved like scythemen skilled to sweep
  Westward o'er the field and nor'ward,
    Death's first harvest there to reap.
  You would say the soft, white smoke-puffs
    Were but languid clouds asleep,
  Here on meadows, there on oak-bluffs,
    Fallen foam of Heaven's blue deep.
  Yet that blossom-white outbreaking
    Smoke wove soon a martyr's shroud.
  Reynolds fell, with soul unquaking,
    Ardent-eyed and open-browed:
  Noble men in humbler raiment
    Fell where shot their graves had plowed,
  Dying not for paltry payment:
    Proud of home, of honor proud.
