  Who, in descent from Heaven's ecstatic throng,
      Was twin to light, and ranged from source to sea,
      And shore to peak, and God, drew up to thee
  The generations happy, pure and strong?
  Freedom, as Erin's was, ere ruthless wrong
      Caught, scourged and hanged it on the out-law's tree;
      And is; for lo! it proves Divinity,
  Transfiguring from anguish, ages long.

  True, they have strangled Freedom on the cross
      Of every Right's suppression--nay, have barred
      His body's tomb, and placed a host on guard!
  Still, He is risen; His faithful mourn no loss.
  He shines forth in their midst. No bolts retard
      His entrance, where grand aims for life engross.
