  Oh, what are England's lines of lords and kings,
      Shakespeare, to thine, a-throb with thought and feeling?
      In thine, imagination shines, revealing
  The soul's convictions, swift on dawn-ward wings
  From beastly life and such Hell-smelling things,
      As wealth and pomp from church and abbey stealing,--
      And hearts in hopes high Belfries, Heavenward pealing,
  As Time, his Sun and Starry censor, swings.

  Would thou wert England's Nature, Bard Supreme,
      To fashion kings and lordlings fit to rule;
      They would be flesh and blood, not fiend and ghoul;
  And would thou wert her Sun, that every beam
  Might not, for tally, show a youth's blood-pool,
      Choking blithe Spring, as, now, to earth's extreme.
