    Musing, between the sunset and the dark,
      As Twilight in unhesitating hands
      Bore from the faint horizon's underlands,
    Silvern and chill, the moon's phantasmal ark,
    I heard the sea, and far away could mark
      Where that unalterable waste expands
      In sevenfold sapphire from the mournful sands,
    And saw beyond the deep a vibrant spark.

    There sank the sun Arcturus, and I thought:
      Star, by an ocean on a world of thine,
        May not a being, born like me to die,
    Confront a little the eternal Naught
      And watch our isolated sun decline--
        Sad for his evanescence, even as I?

                                      _George Sterling_
