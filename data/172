     Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,
     Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,
     Relieve my anguish, and restore the light;
     With dark forgetting of my care return.

     And let the day be time enough to mourn
     The shipwreck of my ill adventured youth:
     Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,
     Without the torment of the night's untruth.

     Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires,
     To model forth the passions of the morrow;
     Never let rising Sun approve you liars
     To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow:

     Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain,
     And never wake to feel the day's disdain.

     S. DANIEL.
