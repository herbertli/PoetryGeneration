    FIRE OF PURIFICATION.

    CANTO XXVII.

  Now was the sun so stationed, as when first
  His early radiance quivers on the heights,
  Where streamed his Maker's blood; while Libra hangs
  Above Hesperian Ebro; and new fires,
  Meridian, flash on Ganges' yellow tide.
    So day was sinking, when the angel of God
  Appeared before us. Joy was in his mien.
  Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink;
  And with a voice, whose lively clearness far
  Surpassed our human, "Blessed are the pure
  In heart," he sang: then near him as we came,
  "Go ye not further, holy spirits!" he cried,
  "Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list
  Attentive to the song ye hear from thence."
  I, when I heard his saying, was as one
  Laid in the grave. My hands together clasped,
  And upward stretching, on the fire I looked;
  And busy fancy conjured up the forms
  Erewhile beheld alive consumed in flames.
    The escorting spirits turned with gentle looks
  Toward me; and the Mantuan spake: "My son,
  Here torment thou may'st feel, but canst not death.
  Remember thee, remember thee, if I
  Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee; now I come
  More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?
  Of this be sure; though in its womb that flame
  A thousand years contained thee, from thy head
  No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,
  Approach; and with thy hands thy vesture's hem
  Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.
  Lay now all fear, oh! lay all fear aside.
  Turn hither, and come onward undismayed."
    I still, though conscience urged, no step advanced.
