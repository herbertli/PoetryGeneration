    Ah, who shall sound the hero's funeral march?
    And what shall be the music of his dirge?
    No single voice may chant the Nation's grief,
    No formal strain can give its woe relief.
    The pent-up anguish of the loyal wife,
    The sobs of those who, nearest in this life,
    Still hold him closely in the life beyond;--
    These first, with threnody of memories fond.
  But look! Forth press a myriad mourners thronging,
    With hearts that throb in sorrow's exaltation,
  Moved by a strange, impassioned, hopeless longing
    To serve him with their love's last ministration.
    Make way! Make way, from wave-bound verge to verge
    Of all our land, that this great multitude
    With lamentation proud albeit subdued,
  Deep murmuring like the ocean's mighty surge,
  May pass beneath the heavens' triumphal arch!
