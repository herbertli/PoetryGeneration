THE SABBATH OF THE SOUL.


  Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
    Of earth and folly born;
  Ye shall not dim the light that streams
    From this celestial morn.

  To-morrow will be time enough
    To feel your harsh control;
  Ye shall not violate, this day,
    The Sabbath of my soul.

  Sleep, sleep forever, guilty thoughts;
    Let fires of vengeance die;
  And, purged from sin, may I behold
    A God of purity!

ANNA L?ITIA BARBAULD.
