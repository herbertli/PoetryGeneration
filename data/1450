  Old Guard of Boston! Halt; Right Face; Attention!
      Order One: quell the weeds in rankest riot
      Where lies Elisha Brown, in conscience, quiet.
  This Brown was John's precursor. Ye, on pension
  For ancient glory, now do duty. Mention
      Elisha's name for countersign--and why, it?
      Because with him, wrong, seen, was to defy it,
  And act, else, was beyond his comprehension.

  Against his home's invasion this man held
      A red-coat regiment for seventeen days,
      Which was a spark to help start freedom's blaze
  And, therefore, Order Two: the weeds all quelled,
  Stand sentries till a statue takes your place
      And throngs shout, "Bravo, Brown!" as 'tis unveiled!
