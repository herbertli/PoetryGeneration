    Straight on he goes with dusky rustling gown.
      His steps are soft, his hands are white and fine;
    And still he bears the goblet on whose crown
      A hundred jewels in the lamplight shine;
    And ever from its edges dripping down
      Falls with dark stain the rich and lustrous wine,
    Wherefrom through all the chamber's shadowy deeps
    A deadly perfume like a vapour creeps.
