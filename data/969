STAR-MIST.

    FROM "STARS."


  More and more stars! behold yon hazy arch
    Spanning the vault on high,
  By planets traversed in majestic march,
    Seeming to earth's dull eye
  A breath of gleaming air: but take thou wing
    Of Faith and upward spring:--
  Into a thousand stars the misty light
  Will part; each star a world with its own day and night.

  Not otherwise of yonder Saintly host
    Upon the glorious shore
  Deem thou. He marks them all, not one is lost;
    By name He counts them o'er.
  Full many a soul, to man's dim praise unknown,
    May on its glory throne
  As brightly shine, and prove as strong in prayer
  As theirs, whose separate beams shoot keenest thro' this air.

JOHN KEBLE.
