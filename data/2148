    Not to be conquered by these headlong days,
      But to stand free: to keep the mind at brood
      On life's deep meaning, nature's altitude
    Of loveliness, and time's mysterious ways;
    At every thought and deed to clear the haze
      Out of our eyes, considering only this,
      What man, what life, what love, what beauty is,
    This is to live, and win the final praise.

    Though strife, ill fortune and harsh human need
      Beat down the soul, at moments blind and dumb
      With agony; yet, patience--there shall come
        Many great voices from life's outer sea,
    Hours of strange triumph, and, when few men heed,
        Murmurs and glimpses of eternity.
