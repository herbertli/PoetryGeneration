  If deaf to Shelley's loudest sky-lark strain,
      His rage at tyrants, and to Byron's thong,
      Nerve-proof, how wake the English to the wrong
  Done their true selves, no less than to the slain,
  When willing weapons for Ambition's gain?
      Aye, weapons only; for, to whom belong
      The minds of England, and treed fields of song--
  Nay, all but grave-ground, grudged by hill and plain?

  O English People, whom the crafty class
      Has huddled into graves from sight and sound
      Of what God hands you, and, with pence, or pound,
  Lids down your wild dead stare,--wake! why so crass?
  See in the Celts spring-burst from underground,
      The Human Resurrection come to pass.
