  Oh, like your sires, you, too, know Freedom's worth
      To Human Spirit. For its liberation,
      A God unrealmed himself by tribulation,
  And was an out-cast on a scornful earth.
  Christ is no myth and, since with Human birth
      He forms new Heavens for blissful habitation--
      There unto is the Freedom of the Nation;
  All other trend is down to dark and dearth.

  When from the darkness rainbowed birth comes pouring,
      Your virtue heeds the voice, Eternity--
      Re-echos: "Let them come." 'Tis Nature's plea
  For broadening progress; Nay, 'tis God imploring
  The Human to take strength for Liberty,
      Truth, Honor, to catch up to the stars, a-soaring.
