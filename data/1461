  Oh, as the earth in discord and in dark,
      When struck by Love on high with will for mace,
      Keeps rattling till each mote finds its true place,
  And mountain, fledged with groves, vies with the lark
  To reach the sunrise; so the madness stark
      Of gold, dethroning blood as God's best grace,
      When struck by Glory's voice drops Nadir-base,
  And blood for Freedom spilt, forms heaven's blue arc.

  The shouts of millions shake Oblivion's mire
      And raise Thrall's Hulks. Look! Justice's stooping sun,
      Seeing in agony's each, a Washington,
  Breaths life in them, and, over Brooklyn's spire
  And New York's Babel Tower, they, one by one,
      Hold Liberty's broading Torch of quenchless fire.
