  Two hostile bullets in mid-air
      Together shocked,
      And swift were locked
  Forever in a firm embrace.
  Then let us men have so much grace
    To take the bullets' place,
    And learn that we are held
      By laws that weld
      Our hearts together!
  As once we battled hand to hand,
    So hand in hand to-day we stand,
      Sworn to each other,
      Brother and brother,
  In storm and mist, or calm, translucent weather:
  And Gettysburg's guns, with their death-giving roar,
  Echoed from ocean to ocean, shall pour
    Quickening life to the nation's core;
      Filling our minds again
    With the spirit of those who wrought in the
        Field of the Flower of Men!
