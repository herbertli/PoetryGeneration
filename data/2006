  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's sticks for your fire,
  Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,
    And beech-twigs, and briar!"
But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
She found 'twas the voice of the False Faerie.

  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's meat for your broth,
  Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,
    And pig's trotters both!"
But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
She found 'twas the voice of the False Faerie.

 "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's a wolf at your door,
  His teeth grinning white,
    And his tongue wagging sore!"
"Nay!" said Dame Hickory, "ye False Faerie!
But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.

  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's buds for your tomb,
Bramble, and lavender,
    And rosemary bloom!"
"Wh-s-st!" said Dame Hickory, "ye False Faerie,
Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me."
