DARKNESS IS THINNING.


  Darkness is thinning; shadows are retreating;
  Morning and light are coming in their beauty;
  Suppliant seek we, with an earnest outcry.
        God the Almighty!

  So that our Master, having mercy on us.
  May repel languor, may bestow salvation.
  Granting us, Father, of thy loving-kindness
        Glory hereafter!

  This, of his mercy, ever bless?Godhead,
  Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, give us,--
  Whom through the wide world celebrate forever
        Blessing and glory!

From the Latin of ST. GREGORY THE GREAT.
