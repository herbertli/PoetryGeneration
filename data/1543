  Dost thou, mad Kaiser, for historic name,
      Set fire to Europe? Is it joy to gaze
      At blacker smoke than Etna's, and a blaze
  That wakes up Chaos, wild to come and claim
  The World, since Light, God-bidden though it came,
      Has failed to dawn upon our human ways?
      O Twin of Chaos! peer thou through the haze!
  'Tis Human Beings feed the crackling flame.

  Beware, the smoke, like Etna's, is the curse
      Of widows on thy people-dooming throne,
      And in no country, more than in thine own,
  Cry out all mothers: "Wherefore bear and nurse?
  To feed war with our sons, our flesh and bone,
      That chaos may reclaim the Universe?"
