    But now the tale is ended, and still keeps
      The stranger hidden in his dusky weed;
    And Nino stands, wide-eyed, as one that sleeps,
      And dimly wonders how his heart doth bleed.
    Anon he bends, yet neither moans nor weeps,
      But hangs atremble, like a broken reed;
    "Ah! bitter fate, that lured and sold us so,
    Poor lady mine; alas for all our woe!"
