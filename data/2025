I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
  And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
And trimly turn my silken sheet
  Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

My pillow sweet of lavender
  Smooth with an amiable hand,
And may the dark pass peacefully by
  As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
  And in my little crystal cup
Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
  That forthwith I may sup.

Withdraw my curtains from the night,
  And let the crisp?crescent shine
Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
  And soothe me with her beams benign.

Dark looks the forest far-away;
  O, listen! through its empty dales
Rings from the solemn echoing boughs
  The music of its nightingales.

Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
  And bid the harpers harp that tune
Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
  Sing clearly to the stars of June.

And bid them play, though I in dreams
  No longer heed their pining strains,
For I would not to silence wake
  When slumber o'er my senses wanes.

You Angels bright who me defend,
  Enshadow me with curv?wing,
And keep me in the darksome night.
  Till dawn another day do bring.
