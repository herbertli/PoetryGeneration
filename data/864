  So varied he, and of his tortuous train
  Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
  To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound
  Of rustling leaves, but minded not, as used
  To such disport before her through the field,
  From every beast; more duteous at her call,
  Than at Circean call the herd disguised.
  He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,
  But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed
  His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,
  Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.
  His gentle dumb expression turned at length
  The eye of Eve, to mark his play; he, glad
  Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue
  Organic, or impulse of vocal air,
  His fraudulent temptation thus began.
    "Wonder not, sovran mistress, if perhaps
  Thou canst who art sole wonder! much less arm
  Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,
  Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze
  Insatiate; I thus single; nor have feared
  Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.
  Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,
  Thee all things living gaze on all things thine
  By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore
  With ravishment beheld! there beat beheld,
  Where universally admired; but here
  In this inclosure wild, these beasts among,
  Beholders rude, and shallow to discern
  Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
  Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who should be seen
  A goddess among gods, adored and served
  By angels numberless, thy daily train."
     So glozed the tempter, and his proem tuned:
  Into the heart of Eve his words made way.
