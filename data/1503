  O Freedom! Up to whose raised hand the seas
      Leap, playful lions, or with head and main
      Across their paws lie couchant--it is pain
  To see thee whose heart beats are God's decrees,
  And vital breathings are infinities,
      Now check thy heart and hold thy breath to gain
      The smile and plaudit of a depths with bane
  In finger tips, while fawning on their knees.

  What! Think the tyrant, whose great soul is trade,
      Whose history, a crater, belching black
      And lurid, keeps glad Easter morning back
  From half the world--loves thee save to invade,
      As blackward planned? loves thee, along whose track
      March Human rights up to the stars parade?
