  "Ye Wreaches, who would lay proud England's head
      Upon the block, and raise her features, then,
      Bloodless and ghastly, for the scorn of men!
  Begone forever. Go where terrors spread
  Their sea and forest mouths to crush you dead.
      Oh, how the clouds shall crimson from each glen,
      A roar with blaze, and flame search out each fen,
  If back to us, yea e'er are vomited."

  To this Parental blessing and God-speed,
      The Pilgrim Fathers gladly made reply:
      "These waves are Conscience's wings along the sky;
  They carry us to God, whose call we heed.
      The further from thy coast of hate and lie,
      The nearer God. On! On!--that is our creed."
