 There is no break in all the wide grey sky,
 Nor light on any field, and the wind grieves,
 And talks of death. Where cold grey waters lie
 Round greyer stones, and the new-fallen leaves
 Heap the chill hollows of the naked woods,
 A lisping moan, an inarticulate cry,
 Creeps far among the charnel solitudes,
 Numbing the waste with mindless misery.
 In these bare paths, these melancholy lands,
 What dream, or flesh, could ever have been young?
 What lovers have gone forth with link?hands?
 What flowers could ever have bloomed, what birds have sung?
 Life, hopes, and human things seem wrapped away,
 With shrouds and spectres, in one long decay.
