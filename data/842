WHAT WAS HIS CREED?

    "Religion relates to life, and the life of religion is to do
    good."--SWEDENBORG.


  He left a load of anthracite
    In front of a poor woman's door.
  When the deep snow, frozen and white,
    Wrapped street and square, mountain and moor.
        That was his deed.
          He did it well.
        "What was his creed?"
          I cannot tell.

  Blessed "in his basket and his store,"
    In sitting down and rising up;
  When more he got, he gave the more,
    Withholding not the crust and cup.
        He took the lead
          In each good task.
        "What was his creed?"
          I did not ask.

  His charity was like the snow,
    Soft, white, and silent in its fall;
  Not like the noisy winds that blow
    From shivering trees the leaves,--a pall
        For flowers and weed,
          Drooping below.
        "What was his creed?"
          The poor may know.

  He had great faith in loaves of bread
    For hungry people, young and old,
  Hope he inspired; kind words he said
    To those he sheltered from the cold.
        For we should feed
          As well as pray.
        "What was his creed?"
          I cannot say.

  In words he did not put his trust;
    His faith in words he never writ;
  He loved to share his cup and crust
    With all mankind who needed it.
        In time of need
          A friend was he.
        "What was his creed?"
          He told not me.

  He put his trust in heaven, and he
    Worked well with hand and head;
  And what he gave in charity
    Sweetened his sleep and daily bread.
        Let us take heed,
          For life is brief.
        What was his creed--What
          his belief?
