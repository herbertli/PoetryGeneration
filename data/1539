  All beings, legioning celestial light,
      Moved in procession toward a vacant throne.
      Their chant was faith and hope, as, now, our own.
  At last, it came to pass, their faith grew sight.
  They saw One Star in night's down-fall, stay white
      And, by the Holy Spirit brighter blown,
      Ascend in Heaven, till there, as high and lone,
  As over Nature's marveling zenith height.

  Reaching the throne, its queen, this star became.
      Awed by the Triune's Honor as her crown,
      The legions, circling, soared with eyes cast down;
  But, when their wonder heard the strange, new name
  In Heaven, from Christ's lips, "Mother," how they shone,
      Reflecting Christ's child-eyes, with love aflame!
