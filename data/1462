  Hate thou not any man, for at the worst,
      He still is brother. Will a glance not find
      Whole peoples alchemied from heart and mind
  To steal projectiles by a craft, accursed
  By Human Nature? Aye, for, as they burst
      At dusk, or midnight, slamming Heaven behind
      And crashing Hell wide open, 'tis mankind
  Is shattered and quick-gulping grave slake thirst.

  Hate thou no man, but scorn all crafts, that smelt
      The heart and mind for huge projectiles, shattered
      When bursting grandly that some pride be flattered.
  Nature beholds not Saxon, Slav, nor Celt;
  She only sees the Human fragments scattered,
      And, covering them, her eyes to rivers melt.
