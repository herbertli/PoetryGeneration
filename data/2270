 Already in the dew-wrapped vineyards dry
 Dense weights of heat press down. The large bright drops
 Shrink in the leaves. From dark acacia tops
 The nuthatch flings his short reiterate cry;
 And ever as the sun mounts hot and high
 Thin voices crowd the grass. In soft long strokes
 The wind goes murmuring through the mountain oaks.
 Faint wefts creep out along the blue and die.
 I hear far in among the motionless trees--
 Shadows that sleep upon the shaven sod--
 The thud of dropping apples. Reach on reach
 Stretch plots of perfumed orchard, where the bees
 Murmur among the full-fringed golden-rod,
 Or cling half-drunken to the rotting peach.
