  Our Country still is in the womb, dark Time.
      It shows life by its brisk and robust turns,
      Which thrill the Mother, Liberty, who yearns
  To see her man-child born. Oh, how sublime
  With genius, not of one, but every climb
      Where art forms beauty, or the spirit spurns
      The foul and spurious,--her desire, that burns
  Prenatally in him, to form him prime!

  Oh People, all--Italian, Spanish, French,
      Dutch, English, Irish, German, Jew, and Greek--
      What see you, as you climb the Future's Peak?
  Oh! no illusion. What looms there, shall wrench
  From life, all monsters out from Hell, to seek
      Dead consciences and plague earth with their stench.
