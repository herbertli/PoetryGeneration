GOD IS EVERYWHERE.


  A trodden daisy, from the sward,
    With tearful eye I took,
  And on its ruined glories I,
    With moving heart, did look;
  For, crushed and broken though it was,
    That little flower was fair;
  And oh! I loved the dying bud,
    For God was there!

  I stood upon the sea-beat shore,
    The waves came rushing on;
  The tempest raged in giant wrath,
    The light of day was gone.
  The sailor from his drowning bark
    Sent up his dying prayer;
  I looked amid the ruthless storm,
    And God was there!

  I sought a lonely, woody dell,
    Where all things soft and sweet,
  Birds, flowers, and trees, and running streams,
    Mid bright sunshine did meet:
  I stood beneath an old oak's shade,
    And summer round was fair;
  I gazed upon the peaceful scene,
    And God was there!

  I saw a home--a happy home--
    Upon a bridal day,
  And youthful hearts were blithesome there,
    And aged hearts were gay:
  I sat amid the smiling band
    Where all so blissful were--
  Among the bridal maidens sweet--
    And God was there!

  I stood beside an infant's couch,
    When light had left its eye--
  I saw the mother's bitter tears,
    I heard her woful cry--
  I saw her kiss its fair pale face,
    And smooth its yellow hair;
  And oh, I loved the mourner's home,
    For God was there!

  I sought a cheerless wilderness--
    A desert, pathless wild--
  Where verdure grew not by the streams,
    Where beauty never smiled;
  Where desolation brooded o'er
    A muirland lone and bare,
  And awe upon my spirit crept,
    For God was there!

  I looked upon the lowly flower,
    And on each blade of grass;
  Upon the forests, wide and deep,
    I saw the tempests pass:
  I gazed on all created things
    In earth, in sea, and air;
  Then bent the knee--for God, in love,
    Was everywhere!
