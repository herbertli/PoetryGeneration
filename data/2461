    No paragon was he,
  But moulded in the rough
  With every fault and scar
  Ingrained, and plain for all to see:
  Even as the rocks and mountains are,
  Common perhaps, yet wrought of such true stuff
  That common nature in his essence grew
  To something which till then it never knew;
  Ay, common as a vast, refreshing wind
  That sweeps the continent, or as some star
  Which, 'mid a million, shines out well-defined:
  With honest soul on duty bent,
  A servant-soldier, President;
  Meekest when crowned with victory,
  And greatest in adversity!
