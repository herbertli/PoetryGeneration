     Two Voices are there; one is of the Sea,
     One of the Mountains; each a mighty voice:
     In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,
     They were thy chosen music, Liberty!

     There came a tyrant, and with holy glee
     Thou fought'st against him,--but hast vainly striven:
     Thou from thy Alpine holds at length are driven
     Where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee.

     --Of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft;
     Then cleave, O cleave to that which still is left--
     For, high-soul'd Maid, what sorrow would it be

     That Mountain floods should thunder as before,
     And Ocean bellow from his rocky shore,
     And neither awful Voice be heard by Thee!

     W. WORDSWORTH.
