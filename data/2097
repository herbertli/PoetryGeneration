    And now this midnight, as he sits forlorn,
      The printed page for him no meaning bears;
    With every word some torturing dream is born;
      And every thought is like a step that scares
    Old memories up to make him weep and mourn.
      He cannot turn but from their latchless lairs,
    The weary shadows of his lost delight
    Rise up like dusk birds through the lonely night.
