     Pack, clouds, away, and welcome day,
      With night we banish sorrow;
     Sweet air blow soft, mount larks aloft
      To give my Love good-morrow!
     Wings from the wind to please her mind,
      Notes from the lark I'll borrow;
     Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale sing,
      To give my Love good-morrow;
        To give my Love good-morrow
        Notes from them both I'll borrow.

     Wake from thy nest, Robin-redbreast!
      Sing, birds, in every furrow;
     And from each hill, let music shrill
      Give my fair Love good-morrow!
     Blackbird and thrush in every bush,
      Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!
     You pretty elves, amongst yourselves
      Sing my fair Love good-morrow;
        To give my Love good-morrow
        Sing birds, in every furrow!

     T. HEYWOOD.
