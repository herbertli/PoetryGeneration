THE THREE SCARS.


  This I got on the day that Goring
  Fought through York, like a wild beast roaring--
  The roofs were black, and the streets were full,
  The doors built up with packs of wool;
  But our pikes made way through a storm of shot,
  Barrel to barrel till locks grew hot;
  Frere fell dead, and Lucas was gone,
  But the drum still beat and the flag went on.

  This I caught from a swinging sabre,
  All I had from a long night's labor;
  When Chester[A] flamed, and the streets were red,
  In splashing shower fell the molten lead,
  The fire sprang up, and the old roof split,
  The fire-ball burst in the middle of it;
  With a clash and a clang the troopers they ran,
  For the siege was over ere well began.

  This I got from a pistol butt
  (Lucky my head's not a hazel nut);
  The horse they raced, and scudded and swore;
  There were Leicestershire gantlemen, seventy score;
  Up came the "Lobsters," covered with steel--
  Down we went with a stagger and reel;
  Smash at the flag, I tore it to rag.
  And carried it off in my foraging bag.
