     I fear thy kisses, gentle maiden;
     Thou needest not fear mine;
     My spirit is too deeply laden
     Ever to burthen thine.

     I fear thy mien, thy tones, thy motion;
     Thou needest not fear mine;
     Innocent is the heart's devotion
     With which I worship thine.

     P.B. SHELLEY.
