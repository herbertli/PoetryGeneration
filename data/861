                          The orb he roamed
  With narrow search; and with inspection deep
  Considered every creature, which of all
  Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found
  The serpent subtlest beast of all the field.
  Him, after long debate, irresolute
  Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose
  Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom
  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
  From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake
  Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,
  As from his wit and native subtlety
  Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed.
  Doubt might beget of diabolic power
  Active within, beyond the sense of brute.
