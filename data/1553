  How thy Half Century shines over head!
      'Tis an unfading rain-bow, one whose dyes
      Are richer and more numerous to the eyes
  Of Angels, than to ours. Its rays, if spread
  Above a flood of sin and world of dead,
      Give to the drowned, new life, new earth, new skies.
      Night counts her stars, but falters, when souls rise
  Bright with the Grace which God's annointed shed.

  Belov'd Irene, how great our joy to see
      Thine arch, aglow with virtue's every hue!
      Oh, how much more must they rejoice, who view
  From inner Heaven, the arch that is for thee,
  Triumphal! for than vows like thine, lived true,
      No grander arch from earth to heaven could be.
