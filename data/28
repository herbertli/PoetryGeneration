    Dance there upon the shore;
    What need have you to care
    For wind or water's roar?
    And tumble out your hair
    That the salt drops have wet;
    Being young you have not known
    The fool's triumph, nor yet
    Love lost as soon as won.
    And he, the best warrior, dead
    And all the sheaves to bind!
    What need that you should dread
    The monstrous crying of wind?

                    _William Butler Yeats_
