  O Freedom! as thy sister spirit, Spring,
      Pausing above the earth, sees every hue
      Of her prismatic crown, reflected true
  In forests and in fields, and fledgling's wing,
  So thou dost see thy spirit glorying
      With faith, that man is more than Nature's spew--
      In human spirit that, from beauty drew
  First breath to know that soul is more than thing.

  O Freedom! fain we follow thee in flight
      From chaos to God's glory round and round,
      Aloft! how like an elk pursued by hound,
  To brinks thou springest toward the distant height
      And, on bent knees, then speedest without sound,
      Like Faith through Death, till, lo! thou dost alight.
