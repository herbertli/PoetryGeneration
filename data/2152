    What is more large than knowledge and more sweet;
      Knowledge of thoughts and deeds, of rights and wrongs,
      Of passions and of beauties and of songs;
    Knowledge of life; to feel its great heart beat
    Through all the soul upon her crystal seat;
      To see, to feel, and evermore to know;
      To till the old world's wisdom till it grow
    A garden for the wandering of our feet.

    Oh for a life of leisure and broad hours,
      To think and dream, to put away small things,
        This world's perpetual leaguer of dull naughts;
    To wander like the bee among the flowers
      Till old age find us weary, feet and wings
        Grown heavy with the gold of many thoughts.
