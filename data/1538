  Beauty is love and, hence is heightening fire,
      Consuming Nature. All the dark can bring
      To quench it, feeds it. Look! how everything
  Is caught in the blaze, which mounts up high and higher!
  Oh! truly, 'tis a vision to inspire
      The soul with transport, more than joy can sing;
      For, if not for the blaze, what cold would sting
  Poor mortals, who crowd round it, nigh and nigher!

  Is beauty not the camp-fire, which one host
      Leaves burning for another, close behind?
      Yea, yea, the Powers Divine, O Human Kind!
  Have left their camp-fire burning on the coast,
  Where they embarked from glimpse of Human mind,
      To give you warmth and light to hold your post.
