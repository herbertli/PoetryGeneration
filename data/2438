  I warn, like the one drop of rain
  On your face, ere the storm;
  Or tremble in whispered refrain
    With your blood, beating warm.
  I am the presence that ever
  Baffles your touch's endeavor,--
  Gone like the glimmer of dust
    Dispersed by a gust.
  I am the absence that taunts you,
  The fancy that haunts you;
  The ever unsatisfied guess
  That, questioning emptiness,
  Wins a sigh for reply.
    Nay; nothing am I,
    But the flight of a breath--
      For I am Death!
