 A moment the wild swallows like a flight
 Of withered gust-caught leaves, serenely high,
 Toss in the windrack up the muttering sky.
 The leaves hang still. Above the weird twilight,
 The hurrying centres of the storm unite
 And spreading with huge trunk and rolling fringe,
 Each wheeled upon its own tremendous hinge
 Tower darkening on. And now from heaven's height
 With the long roar of elm-trees swept and swayed,
 And pelted waters, on the vanished plain
 Plunges the blast. Behind the wild white flash
 That splits abroad the pealing thunder-crash,
 Over bleared fields and gardens disarrayed,
 Column on column comes the drenching rain.
