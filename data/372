     The merchant, to secure his treasure,
     Conveys it in a borrow'd name:
     Euphelia serves to grace my measure,
     But Cloe is my real flame.

     My softest verse, my darling lyre
     Upon Euphelia's toilet lay--
     When Cloe noted her desire
     That I should sing, that I should play.

     My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,
     But with my numbers mix my sighs:
     And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise,
     I fix my soul on Cloe's eyes.

     Fair Cloe blush'd: Euphelia frown'd:
     I sung, and gazed; I play'd, and trembled:
     And Venus to the Loves around
     Remark'd how ill we all dissembled.

     M. PRIOR.
