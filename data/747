LITANY.


  Saviour, when in dust to Thee
  Low we bend the adoring knee;
  When, repentant, to the skies
  Scarce we lift our weeping eyes,--
  O, by all Thy pains and woe
  Suffered once for man below,
  Bending from Thy throne on high,
  Hear our solemn litany!

  By Thy helpless infant years;
  By Thy life of want and tears;
  By Thy days of sore distress
  In the savage wilderness;
  By the dread mysterious hour
  Of the insulting tempter's power,--
  Turn, O, turn a favoring eye,
  Hear our solemn litany!

  By the sacred griefs that wept
  O'er the grave where Lazarus slept;
  By the boding tears that flowed
  Over Salem's loved abode;
  By the anguished sigh that told
  Treachery lurked within Thy fold,--
  From Thy seat above the sky
  Hear our solemn litany!

  By Thine hour of dire despair;
  By Thine agony of prayer;
  By the cross, the nail, the thorn,
  Piercing spear, and torturing scorn;
  By the gloom that veiled the skies
  O'er the dreadful sacrifice,--
  Listen to our humble cry,
  Hear our solemn litany!

  By Thy deep expiring groan;
  By the sad sepulchral stone;
  By the vault whose dark abode
  Held in vain the rising God;
  O, from earth to heaven restored,
  Mighty, reascended Lord,--
  Listen, listen to the cry
  Of our solemn litany!

SIR ROBERT GRANT.
