THE LITTLE CLOUD.[A]

[Footnote A: Arousing of Anti-Slavery agitation, when it was proposed
in Congress to abolish the "Missouri Compromise" and throw open the
Territories to slavery if their people should so vote.]

[1853.]

  As when, on Carmel's sterile steep,
    The ancient prophet bowed the knee,
  And seven times sent his servant forth
    To look toward the distant sea;

  There came at last a little cloud,
    Scarce larger than the human hand,
  Spreading and swelling till it broke
    In showers on all the herbless land;

  And hearts were glad, and shouts went up,
    And praise to Israel's mighty God,
  As the sear hills grew bright with flowers,
    And verdure clothed the valley sod,--

  Even so our eyes have waited long;
    But now a little cloud appears,
  Spreading and swelling as it glides
    Onward into the coming years.

  Bright cloud of Liberty! full soon,
    Far stretching from the ocean strand,
  Thy glorious folds shall spread abroad,
    Encircling our beloved land.

  Like the sweet rain on Judah's hills,
    The glorious boon of love shall fall,
  And our bond millions shall arise,
    As at an angel's trumpet-call.

  Then shall a shout of joy go up,--
    The wild, glad cry of freedom come
  From hearts long crushed by cruel hands,
    And songs from lips long sealed and dumb;

  And every bondman's chain be broke,
    And every soul that moves abroad
  In this wide realm shall know and feel
    The bless?Liberty of God.

JOHN HOWARD BRYANT.
