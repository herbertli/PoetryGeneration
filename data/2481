  Men of New Hampshire, Pennsylvanians,
    Maine men, firm as the rock's rough ledge!
  Swift Mississippians, lithe Carolinians
    Bursting over the battle's edge!
  Bold Indiana men; gallant Virginians;
    Jersey and Georgia legions clashing;--
  Pick of Connecticut; quick Vermonters;
    Louisianians, madly dashing;--
  And, swooping still to fresh encounters,
    New-York myriads, whirlwind-led!--
  All your furious forces, meeting,
    Torn, entangled, and shifting place,
  Blend like wings of eagles beating
    Airy abysses, in angry embrace.
  Here in the midmost struggle combining--
    Flags immingled and weapons crossed--
  Still in union your States troop shining:
    Never a star from the lustre is lost!
