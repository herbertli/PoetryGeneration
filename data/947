SONG OF THE SILENT LAND.

    "Das stille Land."


          Into the Silent Land!
      Ah, who shall lead us thither?
  Clouds in the evening sky more darkly gather,
  And shattered wrecks lie thicker on the strand.
      Who leads us with a gentle hand
            Thither, oh, thither,
          Into the Silent Land?

           Into the Silent Land!
       To you, ye boundless regions
  Of all perfection! Tender morning-visions
    Of beauteous souls! The future's pledge and band!
      Who in life's battle firm doth stand
       Shall bear hope's tender blossoms
         Into the Silent Land!

          O Land! O Land!
      For all the broken-hearted
  The mildest herald by our fate allotted
    Beckons, and with inverted torch doth stand
      To lead us with a gentle hand
  Into the land of the great departed,
        Into the Silent Land!

JOHANN GAUDENZ VON SALIS.
