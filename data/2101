      A stranger enters with slow steps, unsought,
    A long robed monk, and in his hand he bears
      A jewelled goblet curiously wrought;
    But of his face beneath the cowl he wears
      For all his searching Nino seeth nought;
    And slowly past him with long stride he hies,
    While Nino follows with bewildered eyes.
