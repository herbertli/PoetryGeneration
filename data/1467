  America! 'Tis not thy mines of gold,
      Nor streams from mounts to meadows, like God's hand
      From out the heavens, a-flash across the land
  In long, deep sweeps to quicken winter's mould
  To reaps of ripeness,--that mine eyes behold,
      Invoking thee; for these are mere shore-sand
      To the broad ocean of thy spirit grand,
  Forming for man a new world for the old.

  'Tis Liberty, to whose most blessed birth
      The stars all lead, rejoicing, which souls thee
      With God's compassion for humanity,--
  That I invoke; and, now, when all the earth
  Bears palms and chants hosannas--what! shall she,
      The most devout, be shut from Freedom's mirth?
