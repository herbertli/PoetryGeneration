  Colors that tremble and perish,
    Atoms that follow the law,
  You mirror the truth which we cherish,
    You mirror the spirit we saw.
  Glow of the daybreak tender,
    Flushed with an opaline gleam,
  And passionate sunset-splendor--
    Ye both but embody a dream.
  Visions of cloud-hidden glory
    Breaking from sources of light
  Mimic the mist of life's story.
    Mingled of scarlet and white.
  Sunset-clouds iridescent,
    Opals, and mists of the day,
  Are thrilled alike with the crescent
    Delight of a deathless ray
  Shot through the hesitant trouble
    Of particles floating in space,
  And touching each wandering bubble
    With tints of a rainbowed grace.
  So through the veil of emotion
    Trembles the light of the truth;
  And so may the light of devotion
    Glorify life--age and youth.
  Sufferings,--pangs that seem cruel,--
    These are but atoms adrift:
  The light streams through, and a jewel
    Is formed for us, Heaven's own gift!
