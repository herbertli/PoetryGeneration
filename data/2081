      Oh night and sleep,
      Ye are so soft and deep,
    I am so weary, come ye soon to me.
      Oh hours that creep,
      With so much time to weep,
    I am so tired, can ye no swifter be?

      Come, night, anear;
      I'll whisper in thine ear
    What makes me so unhappy, full of care;
      Dear night, I die
      For love that all men buy
    With tears, and know not it is dark despair.

      Dear night, I pray,
      How is it that men say
    That love is sweet? It is not sweet to me.
      For one boy's sake
      A poor girl's heart must break;
    So sweet, so true, and yet it could not be!

      Oh, I loved well,
      Such love as none can tell:
    It was so true, it could not make him know:
      For he was blind,
      All light and all unkind:
    Oh, had he known, would he have hurt me so?

      Oh night and sleep,
      Ye are so soft and deep,
    I am so weary, come ye soon to me.
      Oh hours that creep,
      With so much time to weep,
    I am so tired, can ye no swifter be?
