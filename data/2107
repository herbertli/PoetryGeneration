    "And aye with that luxurious fire you fed
      Your dangerous longing daily, crumb by crumb;
    Nor ever cared that still above your head
      The shadow grew; for that your lips were dumb.
    You knew full keenly you could never wed:
      'Twas all a dream: the end must surely come;
    For not on thee her father's eyes were turned
    To find a son, when mighty lords were spurned.
