    When she is ill my laughter cowers;
    An exile with a broken rhyme,
    My head upon the breast of time,
    I hear the heart-beat of the hours;
    I close my eyes without a sigh;
    The vision of her flutters by
    As glints the light of Mary's eyes
    Upon the lakes in Paradise.

    I seem to reach an olden town
    And enter at the sunset gate;
    And as the streets I hurry down,
    I find the men are all elate,
    As if an angel of the Lord
    Had passed with dearest word and nod,
    Remembered like a yearning chord
    Of songs the people sing to God;
    I come upon the sunrise gate--
    As silent as her listless room--
    There seven beggers sing and wait
    And this the song that breaks the gloom:

    God a 'mercy is most kind;
    She the fairest passed this way;
    We the lowest were not blind;
    God a 'mercy bless the day.

                        _Roscoe W. Brink_
