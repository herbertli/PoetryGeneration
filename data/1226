THE CAUSE OF THE SOUTH.

FROM "SENTINEL SONGS."


  The fallen cause still waits,--
    Its bard has not come yet,
  His song--through one of to-morrow's gates
    Shall shine--but never set.

  But when he comes--he'll sweep
    A harp with tears all stringed,
  And the very notes he strikes will weep,
    As they come, from his hand, woe-winged.

  Ah! grand shall be his strain,
    And his songs shall fill all climes,
  And the Rebels shall rise and march again
    Down the lines of his glorious rhymes.

  And through his verse shall gleam
    The swords that flashed in vain,
  And the men who wore the gray shall seem
    To be marshalling again.

  But hush! between his words
    Peer faces sad and pale,
  And you hear the sound of broken chords
    Beat through the poet's wail.

  Through his verse the orphans cry--
    The terrible undertone!
  And the father's curse and the mother's sigh,
    And the desolate young wife's moan.
