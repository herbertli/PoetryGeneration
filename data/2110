      Thou, wretched Nino, thou alone canst know.
    Down at his feet with many a moan she knelt,
      And prayed that he would never wound her so.

      The flintiest heart; but his could never glow.
    He sat with clench?hands and straightened head,
    And frowned, and glared, and turned from white to red.
