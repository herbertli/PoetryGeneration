    The world is bright with beauty, and its days
      Are filled with music; could we only know
      True ends from false, and lofty things from low;
    Could we but tear away the walls that graze
    Our very elbows in life's frosty ways;
      Behold the width beyond us with its flow,
      Its knowledge and its murmur and its glow,
    Where doubt itself is but a golden haze.

    Ah brothers, still upon our pathway lies
      The shadow of dim weariness and fear,
    Yet if we could but lift our earthward eyes
      To see, and open our dull ears to hear,
      Then should the wonder of this world draw near
    And life's innumerable harmonies.
