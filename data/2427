  I dreamed my kisses on your hair
  Turned into roses. Circling bloom
  Crowned the loose-lifted tresses there.
  "O Love," I cried, "forever
  Dwell wreathed, and perfume-haunted
  By my heart's deep honey-breath!"
  But even as I bending looked, I saw
  The roses were not; and, instead, there lay
  Pale, feathered flakes and scentless
  Ashes upon your hair!
