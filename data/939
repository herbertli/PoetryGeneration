IT KINDLES ALL MY SOUL.

    "Urit me Patriae decor."


      It kindles all my soul,
  My country's loveliness! Those starry choirs
      That watch around the pole,
  And the moon's tender light, and heavenly fires
      Through golden halls that roll.
  O chorus of the night! O planets, sworn
      The music of the spheres
  To follow! Lovely watchers, that think scorn
      To rest till day appears!
  Me, for celestial homes of glory born,
      Why here, O, why so long,
  Do ye behold an exile from on high?
      Here, O ye shining throng,
  With lilies spread the mound where I shall lie:
      Here let me drop my chain,
  And dust to dust returning, cast away
      The trammels that remain;
  The rest of me shall spring to endless day!

From the Latin of CASIMIR OF POLAND.
