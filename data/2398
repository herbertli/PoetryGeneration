    But soon, returning duly,
  Dawn whitens the wet hilltops bluely.
  To her vision pure and cold
  The night's wild tale is told
  On the glistening leaf, in the mid-road pool,
  The garden mold turned dark and cool,
  And the meadows' trampled acres.
  But hark, how fresh the song of the winged music-makers!
  For now the moanings bitter,
  Left by the rain, make harmony
  With the swallow's matin-twitter,
  And the robin's note, like the wind's in a tree.
  The infant morning breathes sweet breath,
  And with it is blent
  The wistful, wild, moist scent
  Of the grass in the marsh which the sea nourisheth:
  And behold!
  The last reluctant drop of the storm,
  Wrung from the roof, is smitten warm
  And turned to gold;
  For in its veins doth run
  The very blood of the bold, unsullied sun!
