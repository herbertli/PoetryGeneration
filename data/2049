    One moment the slim cloudflakes seem to lean
    With their sad sunward faces aureoled,
    And longing lips set downward brightening
    To take the last sweet hand kiss of the king,
    Gone down beyond the closing west acold;
    Paying no reverence to the slender queen,
    That like a curv?olive leaf of gold
    Hangs low in heaven, rounded toward sun,
    Or the small stars that one by one unfold
    Down the gray border of the night begun.
