    The monk's voice pauses like some mournful flute,
      Whose pondered closes for sheer sorrow fail,
    And then with hand that seems as it would suit
      A soft girl best, it is so light and frail,
    He turns half round, and for a moment mute
      Points to the goblet, and so ends his tale:
    "Mine oath is kept, thy lady's last command;
    'Tis but a short hour since it left her hand."
