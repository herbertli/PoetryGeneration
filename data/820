SUNDAY MORNING BELLS.


  From the near city comes the clang of bells:
  Their hundred jarring diverse tones combine
  In one faint misty harmony, as fine
  As the soft note yon winter robin swells.
  What if to Thee in thine infinity
  These multiform and many-colored creeds
  Seem but the robe man wraps as masquers' weeds
  Round the one living truth them givest him--Thee?
  What if these varied forms that worship prove,
  Being heart-worship, reach thy perfect ear
  But as a monotone, complete and clear,
  Of which the music is, through Christ's name, love?
  Forever rising in sublime increase
  To "Glory in the highest,--on earth peace"?

DINAH M. MULOCK CRAIK.
