  All Virtues from the longing of the soul;
      From wisdom, gained by sorrow through long ages;
      From inspiration of the bards, in rages
  That inter-marrying maniacs control
  A people's life, and drain its sea to shoal,
  And from the vision of sky-topping sages,
      Gasping for breath from rot in all its stages,--
  Aye, these and new-born Genius loom there Whole.

  Look, People! Little less than God's own size,
      Your virtues merge and, with speed God-ward, burn,
      An unconsuming sun, that at no turn
  In spiral flight, for still a grander rise,
  Lets night advance where human Rights still yearn,
      Except with great, new stars and dawning skys!
