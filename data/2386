  The trumpet, with a giant sound,
    Its harsh war-summons wildly sings;
    And, bursting forth like mountain-springs,
  Poured from the hillside camping-ground,
    Each swift battalion shouting flings
  Its force in line; where you may see
  The men, broad-shouldered, heavily
  Sway to the swing of the march; their heads
  Dark like the stones in river-beds.

    Lightly the autumn breezes
    Play with the shining dust-cloud
    Rising to the sunset rays
    From feet of the moving column.
    Soft, as you listen, comes
    The echo of iterant drums,
    Brought by the breezes light
    From the files that follow the road.
    A moment their guns have glowed
    Sun-smitten: then out of sight
    They suddenly sink,
    Like men who touch a new grave's brink!
