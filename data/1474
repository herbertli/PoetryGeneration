  The ocean, holding pure the azure's blue,
      Laughs at the tempests, with one empire's dust
      After an other, to round out Earth's crust.
  Ah, so does Human Nature hold the hue
  It takes from heaven, its conscience, and laughs, too,
      At madness, wrecking life and with its gust
      Forming new islands, where Pride, Greed, or Lust,
  Welcomes the crater's glare, in sun-light's lieu.

  Look in the sea and deep, what scattered rock,
      The islands which at dusk, the tempest piled!
      Ere rose a star, they sank with crews, beguiled.
  O Tempests that with world formations, mock
  The good Creator, how, as ye grow wild,
      Earth quakes and no live thing survives the shock.
