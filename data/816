WHAT I LIVE FOR.


  I live for those who love me,
    Whose hearts are kind and true,
  For heaven that smiles above me,
    And waits my spirit, too;
  For all the ties that bind me,
  For all the tasks assigned me.
  And bright hopes left behind me,
    And good that I can do.

  I live to learn their story
    Who've suffered for my sake,
  To emulate their glory,
    And follow in their wake;
  Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages,
  The noble of all ages,
  Whose deeds crown history's pages,
    And Time's great volume make.

  I live to hold communion
    With all that is divine,
  To feel there is a union
    'Twixt Nature's heart and mine;
  To profit by affliction,
  Reap truths from fields of fiction,
  And, wiser from conviction,
    Fulfil each grand design.

  I live to hail that season,
    By gifted minds foretold,
  When men shall rule by reason,
    And not alone by gold;
  When man to man united,
  And every wrong thing righted,
  The whole world shall be lighted
    As Eden was of old.

  I live for those who love me,
    Whose hearts are kind and true,
  For heaven that smiles above me,
    And waits my spirit too;
  For the cause that lacks assistance,
  For the wrong that needs resistance,
  For the future in the distance,
    And the good that I can do.

GEORGE LINNAEUS BANKS.
