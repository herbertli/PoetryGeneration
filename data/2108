    "Thou knowest that new-sprung prince, that proud up-start,
      Pisa's new tyrant with his arm?thralls,
    Who bends of late to take the people's part,
      Yet plays the king among his marble halls,
    Whose gloomy palace in our city's heart
      Frowns like a fortress with its loop-holed walls.
    'Twas him he sought for fair Leonora's hand,
    That so his own declining house might stand.
