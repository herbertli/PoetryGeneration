    Friend, though thy soul should burn thee, yet be still.
      Thoughts were not meant for strife, nor tongues for swords.
      He that sees clear is gentlest of his words,
    And that's not truth that hath the heart to kill.
    The whole world's thought shall not one truth fulfil.
      Dull in our age, and passionate in youth,
      No mind of man hath found the perfect truth,
    Nor shalt thou find it; therefore, friend, be still.

    Watch and be still, nor hearken to the fool,
    The babbler of consistency and rule:
      Wisest is he, who, never quite secure,
        Changes his thoughts for better day by day:
    To-morrow some new light will shine, be sure,
      And thou shalt see thy thought another way.
