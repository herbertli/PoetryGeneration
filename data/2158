    Half god, half brute, within the self-same shell,
      Changers with every hour from dawn till even,
      Who dream with angels in the gate of heaven,
    And skirt with curious eyes the brinks of hell,
    Children of Pan, whom some, the few, love well,
      But most draw back, and know not what to say,
      Poor shining angels, whom the hoofs betray,
    Whose pinions frighten with their goatish smell.

    Half brutish, half divine, but all of earth,
      Half-way 'twixt hell and heaven, near to man,
      The whole world's tangle gathered in one span,
    Full of this human torture and this mirth:
      Life with its hope and error, toil and bliss,
      Earth-born, earth-reared, ye know it as it is.
