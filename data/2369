  How sweetly sang the bobolink,
    When thou, my love, wast nigh!
  His liquid music from the brink
  Of some cloud-fountain seemed to sink,
    Far in the blue-domed sky.

  How sadly sings the bobolink!
    No more my love is nigh:
  Yet rise, my spirit, rise, and drink
  Once more from that cloud-fountain's brink,--
    Once more before I die!
