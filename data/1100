A HOLY NATION.


  Let Liberty run onward with the years,
  And circle with the seasons; let her break
  The tyrant's harshness, the oppressor's spears;
  Bring ripened recompenses that shall make
  Supreme amends for sorrow's long arrears;
  Drop holy benison on hearts that ache;
  Put clearer radiance into human eyes,
  And set the glad earth singing to the skies.

  Clean natures coin pure statutes. Let us cleanse
  The hearts that beat within us; let us mow
  Clear to the roots our falseness and pretence,
  Tread down our rank ambitions, overthrow
  Our braggart moods of puffed self-consequence,
  Plough up our hideous thistles which do grow
  Faster than maize in May time, and strike dead
  The base infections our low greeds have bred.

RICHARD REALF.
