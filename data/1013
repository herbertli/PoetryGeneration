  Our fathers of old were robust, stout, and strong,
  And kept open house with good cheer all day long,
  Which made their plump tenants rejoice in this song.
        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.

  When good Queen Elizabeth sat on the throne,
  Ere coffee and tea, and such slip-slops, were known,
  The world was in terror, if e'en she did frown.
        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.

  In those days, if fleets did presume on the main,
  They seldom or never returned back again;
  As witness the vaunting Armada of Spain.
        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.

  O, then we had stomachs to eat and to fight,
  And when wrongs were cooking, to set ourselves right;
  But now we're--hum?--I could, but--good night;
        _O, the Roast Beef of old England,
           And O, the old English Roast Beef_!

_The last four stanzas added by_ RICHARD LOVERIDGE.
