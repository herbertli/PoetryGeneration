  O many-toned rain!
  It hath caught the strain
  Of a wilder tune,
  Ere the same night's noon,
  When dreams and sleep forsake me,
  And sudden dread doth wake me,
  To hear the booming drums of heaven beat
  The long roll to battle; when the knotted cloud,
  With an echoing loud,
  Bursts asunder
  At the sudden resurrection of the thunder;
  And the fountains of the air,
  Unsealed again, sweep, ruining, everywhere,
  To wrap the world in a watery winding-sheet.
