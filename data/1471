  The righteousness of England! "Tis to kneel
      Full weight on weaker nations, and entone
      Hosannas louder than the victims groan;
  Then, stooping, drink their blood with gulps of zeal."
  What right have wounds, though wide, to throb, or feel?
      'Tis blasphemy to England's crimson throne.
      Knee-deep in Erin's blood, she mocks Christ's moan:
  Forgive them, Lord! they know not their true weal.

  "Whose is the fault? Tis not my arrogance,
      But candor, Lord, that puts the blame on Thee.
      What right hadst Thou to make these people free
  And let all nature prompt them to advance?--
  Oh, no such blunder, Lord, hadst Thou called me,
      Instead of Wisdom, to approve Thy plans!"
