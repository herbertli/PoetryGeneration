MY CREED.


  I hold that Christian grace abounds
    Where charity is seen; that when
  We climb to heaven, 't is on the rounds
    Of love to men.

  I hold all else, named piety,
    A selfish scheme, a vain pretence;
  Where centre is not--can there be
    Circumference?

  This I moreover hold, and dare
    Affirm where'er my rhyme may go,--
  Whatever things be sweet or fair,
    Love makes them so.

  Whether it be the lullabies
    That charm to rest the nursling bird,
  Or the sweet confidence of sighs
    And blushes, made without a word.

  Whether the dazzling and the flush
    Of softly sumptuous garden bowers,
  Or by some cabin door, a bush
    Of ragged flowers.

  'Tis not the wide phylactery,
    Nor stubborn fast, nor stated prayers,
  That make us saints: we judge the tree
    By what it bears.

  And when a man can live apart
    From works, on theologic trust,
  I know the blood about his heart
    Is dry as dust.

ALICE CAREY.
