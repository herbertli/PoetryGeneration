THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.

[The women of Columbus, Mississippi, strewed flowers alike on the
graves of the Confederate and the National soldiers.]


  By the flow of the inland river,
    Whence the fleets of iron have fled,
  Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver
    Asleep are the ranks of the dead;--
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Under the one, the Blue;
        Under the other, the Gray.

  These in the robing of glory,
    Those in the gloom of defeat,
  All with the battle-blood gory,
    In the dusk of eternity meet;--
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Under the laurel, the Blue;
        Under the willow, the Gray.

  From the silence of sorrowful hours
    The desolate mourners go,
  Lovingly laden with flowers
    Alike for the friend and the foe,--
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Under the roses, the Blue;
        Under the lilies, the Gray.

  So with an equal splendor
    The morning sun-rays fall,
  With a touch, impartially tender,
    On the blossoms blooming for all;--
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      'Broidered with gold, the Blue;
        Mellowed with gold, the Gray.

  So when the summer calleth,
    On forest and field of grain
  With an equal murmur falleth
    The cooling drip of the rain;--
      Under the sod and the dew.
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Wet with the rain, the Blue;
        Wet with the rain, the Gray.

  Sadly, but not with upbraiding,
    The generous deed was done;
  In the storm of the years that are fading,
    No braver battle was won;--
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Under the blossoms, the Blue;
        Under the garlands, the Gray.

  No more shall the war-cry sever,
    Or the winding rivers be red;
  They banish our anger forever
    When they laurel the graves of our dead!
      Under the sod and the dew,
        Waiting the judgment-day;--
      Love and tears for the Blue,
        Tears and love for the Gray.

FRANCIS MILES FINCH.
