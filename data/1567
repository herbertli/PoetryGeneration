  A conflict, this, refracted, cloud to cloud!
      Where a white summit? Under crimson seas,
      And these still hightening. Through far azure, Peace
  Listens and, eager, peeps; then, turns headbowed.
  The conflict circling earth, all plains are ploughed
      New rows of gulches. God! can aught appease
      The Dragon with fiend thirst's eternities
  For tongue! The sun might, if it were well sloughed.

  The Dragon, mounting, draws aloft earth's slime
      With which to dim the all-producing Sun
      From broadening light and warmth for every one;
  But, look! The Eagle, with the thirst sublime
  Of Justice, that the right on earth be done--
      Flashes and--hark! 'Tis earth's Te-Deum chime!
