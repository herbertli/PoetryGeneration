SUNRISE.


  As on my bed at dawn I mused and prayed,
  I saw my lattice prankt upon the wall,
  The flaunting leaves and flitting birds withal--
  A sunny phantom interlaced with shade;
  "Thanks be to Heaven," in happy mood I said,
  "What sweeter aid my matins could befall
  Than this fair glory from the east hath made?
  What holy sleights hath God, the Lord of all,
  To bid us feel and see! We are not free
  To say we see not, for the glory comes
  Nightly and daily, like the flowing sea;
  His lustre pierces through the midnight glooms,
  And at prime hours, behold! he follows me
  With golden shadows to my secret rooms."
