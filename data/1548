  Now and in life--not Virgil--breaks a storm
      Of Harpies, harsh to ear and foul to smell.
      It sweeps War's lengthening coast, where each sea-swell
  Is Humans, gasping. Hope drags each cold form
  From hearth to hearth, to find no ember warm;
      Then, their eyes glitter frost, who hear hope yell
      As up she climbs the rocks and falls pell-mell
  Back from small herbs, where monsters swoop and swarm.

  Oh, could the bestial birds, in Virgil's verse,
      See Hope's hands redden, as she rends her hair,
      They would grow human--would not glut, but share;
  Nor, then, shed human semblance for man's curse--
  As ye do, who from want, hold warmth and fair,
      And gorge your bulks to sleep, as want writhes worse!
