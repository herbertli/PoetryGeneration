  O Freedom! whose pure soul and heart embrace
      Translates me into heaven, I draw for breath
      The joy of angels who have not known death.
  Child-like, I look up in thy loving face,
  Else gaze around and point, and curious place
      My hand on Mottoes, hung on high. One saith:
      "Beware, for he not with me scatterith."
  Its meaning comes to me with growth, like grace.

  Ah, as a youngster, on its mother's arm,
      Seeing a hideous thing approaching night,
      Will not lay down its head and shut its eye,
  But will with look and lung express alarm--
  My mind cries out in dread--when sea and sky
      Show dragons, tendencies that work thee harm.
