  Into the fire before me then he walked:
  And Statius, who erewhile no little space
  Had parted us, he prayed to come behind.
    I would have cast me into molten glass
  To cool me, when I entered; so intense
  Raged the conflagrant mass. The sire beloved,
  To comfort me, as he proceeded, still
  Of Beatrice talked. "Her eyes," saith he,
  "E'en now I seem to view." From the other side
  A voice, that sang, did guide us; and the voice
  Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,
  There where the path led upward. "Come," we heard,
  "Come, bless?of my Father." Such the sounds,
  That hailed us from within a light, which shone
  So radiant, I could not endure the view.
  "The sun," it added, "hastes: and evening comes.
  Delay not: ere the western sky is hung
  With blackness, strive ye for the pass." Our way
  Upright within the rock arose, and faced
  Such part of heaven, that from before my steps
  The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.
