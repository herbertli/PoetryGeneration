    Tall pine-tree on McGregor's height,
  How didst thou grow to such a lofty bearing,
  For song of bird or beat of breeze uncaring,
  There where thy shadow touched the dying brow?
  Were all thy sinewy fibres shaped aright?
  Was there no flaw? With what mysterious daring
  Didst thou put forth each murmuring, odorous bough
  And trust it to the frail support of air?
  We only know that thou art now supreme:
  We know not how thou grewest so tall and fair.
  So from the unnoticed, humble earth arose
  The sturdy man whom we, bewailing, deem
  Worthy the wondrous name fame's far voice blows.
  And lo! his ancient foes
  Rise up to praise the plan
  Of modest grandeur, loyal trust,
  And generous power from man to man,
  That lifted him above the formless dust.
  O heart by kindliness betrayed,
  O noble spirit snared and strayed--
  Unmatched, upright thou standest still
  As that firm pine-tree rooted on the hill!
