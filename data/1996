    I saw three witches
    That bowed down like barley,
And straddled their brooms 'neath a louring sky,
    And, mounting a storm-cloud,
    Aloft on its margin,
Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

    I saw three witches
    That mocked the poor sparrows
They carried in cages of wicker along,
    Till a hawk from his eyrie
    Swooped down like an arrow,
Smote on the cages, and ended their song.

    I saw three witches
    That sailed in a shallop,
All turning their heads with a snickering smile,
    Till a bank of green osiers
    Concealed their grim faces,
Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.

    I saw three witches
    Asleep in a valley,
Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,
    Till the moon, creeping upward,
    Looked white through the valley,
And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.
