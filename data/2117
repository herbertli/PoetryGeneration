      For glad amazement, mixed with some dark fear;
    I saw her stand no longer pale and weak,
      But a proud maiden, queenly and most clear,
    With flashing eyes and vermeil in her cheek:
      And on the little table, set anear,
    I marked two goblets of rare workmanship
    With some strange liquor crown?to the lip.
