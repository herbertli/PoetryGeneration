 O Power to whom this earthly clime
   Is but an atom in the whole,
 O Poet-heart of Space and Time,
   O Maker and Immortal Soul,
 Within whose glowing rings are bound,
   Out of whose sleepless heart had birth
 The cloudy blue, the starry round,
   And this small miracle of earth:

 Who liv'st in every living thing,
   And all things are thy script and chart,
 Who rid'st upon the eagle's wing,
   And yearnest in the human heart;
 O Riddle with a single clue,
   Love, deathless, protean, secure,
 The ever old, the ever new,
   O Energy, serene and pure.

 Thou, who art also part of me,
   Whose glory I have sometime seen,
 O Vision of the Ought-to-be,
   O Memory of the Might-have-been,
 I have had glimpses of thy way,
   And moved with winds and walked with stars,
 But, weary, I have fallen astray,
   And, wounded, who shall count my scars?

 O Master, all my strength is gone;
   Unto the very earth I bow;
 I have no light to lead me on;
   With aching heart and burning brow,
 I lie as one that travaileth
   In sorrow more than he can bear;
 I sit in darkness as of death,
   And scatter dust upon my hair.

 The God within my soul hath slept,
   And I have shamed the nobler rule;
 O Master, I have whined and crept;
   O Spirit, I have played the fool.
 Like him of old upon whose head
   His follies hung in dark arrears,
 I groan and travail in my bed,
   And water it with bitter tears.

 I stand upon thy mountain-heads,
   And gaze until mine eyes are dim;
 The golden morning glows and spreads;
   The hoary vapours break and swim.
 I see thy blossoming fields, divine,
   Thy shining clouds, thy blessed trees--
 And then that broken soul of mine--
   How much less beautiful than these!

 O Spirit, passionless, but kind,
   Is there in all the world, I cry,
 Another one so base and blind,
   Another one so weak as I?
 O Power, unchangeable, but just,
   Impute this one good thing to me,
 I sink my spirit to the dust
   In utter dumb humility.
