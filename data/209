     This Life, which seems so fair,
     Is like a bubble blown up in the air
     By sporting children's breath,
     Who chase it everywhere
     And strive who can most motion it bequeath.
     And though it sometimes seem of its own might
     Like to an eye of gold to be fix'd there,
     And firm to hover in that empty height,
     That only is because it is so light.
     --But in that pomp it doth not long appear;
     For when 'tis most admir? in a thought,
     Because it erst was nought, it turns to nought.

     W. DRUMMOND.
