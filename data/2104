    The stranger's voice falls slow and solemnly.
      Tis soft, and rich, and wondrous deep of tone;
    And Nino's face grows white as ivory,
      Listening fast-rooted like a shape of stone.
    Ah, blessed saints, can such a dark thing be?
      And was it death, and is Leonora gone?
    Oh, love is harsh, and life is frail indeed,
    That gives men joy, and then so makes them bleed.
