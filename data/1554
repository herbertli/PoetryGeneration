  The "Church Triumphant" shines in lives like thine,
      Calista! 'Tis the Saints' procession, shown
      In Dante's vision, near Lord Jesus' throne,
  In greatening splendor, never to decline.
  Ah, if our minds grow dark, our hearts repine,
      How, from sweet lives, dear Sister, like thine own,
      Be-Mothering with mercy all who moan,
  A light comes, and a warmth is in its shine.

  We shade our eyes, as when we face the Sun
      On level with the earth, at lives all love--
      The Church Triumphant, as in Heaven above!
  Aye, lives all love for Christ, in every one
  Who suffers wrong, or any pain thereof,
      As on His Throne--such lives as thine, dear Nun.
