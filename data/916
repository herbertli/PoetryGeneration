THE MASTER'S TOUCH.


  In the still air the music lies unheard;
    In the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
  To make the music and the beauty, needs
    The master's touch, the sculptor's chisel keen.

  Great Master, touch us with thy skilful hand;
    Let not the music that is in us die!
  Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor let,
    Hidden and lost, thy form within us lie!

  Spare not the stroke! do with us as thou wilt!
    Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred;
  Complete thy purpose, that we may become
    Thy perfect image, thou our God and Lord!

HORATIUS BONAR.
