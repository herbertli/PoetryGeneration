CARMEN BELLICOSUM.


  In their ragged regimentals
  Stood the old Continentals,
      Yielding not.
  When the grenadiers were lunging,
  And like hail fell the plunging
      Cannon-shot;
      When the files
      Of the isles,
  From the smoky night encampment, bore the banner of the rampant
      Unicorn,
  And grummer, grummer, grummer rolled the roll of the drummer,
      Through the morn!

    Then with eyes to the front all,
    And with guns horizontal,
      Stood our sires;
    And the balls whistled deadly,
    And in streams flashing redly
      Blazed the fires;
      As the roar
      On the shore,
  Swept the strong battle-breakers o'er the green-sodded acres
      Of the plain;
  And louder, louder, louder, cracked the black gun-powder,
      Cracking amain!

    Now like smiths at their forges
    Worked the red St. George's
      Cannoneers;
    And the "villanous saltpetre"
    Rung a fierce, discordant metre
      Round their ears;
      As the swift
      Storm-drift,
  With hot sweeping anger, came the horseguards' clangor
      On our flanks;
  Then higher, higher, higher, burned the old fashioned fire
      Through the ranks!

    Then the bare-headed colonel
    Galloped through the white infernal
      Powder-cloud;
    And his broad sword was swinging
    And his brazen throat was ringing
      Trumpet-loud.
      Then the blue
      Bullets flew,
  And the trooper-jackets redden at the touch of the leaden
      Rifle-breath;
  And rounder, rounder, rounder, roared the iron six-pounder,
      Hurling death!
