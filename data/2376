  Dear love, let this my song fly to you:
    Perchance forget it came from me.
  It shall not vex you, shall not woo you;
    But in your breast lie quietly.

  Only beware, when once it tarries
    I cannot coax it from you, then.
  This little song my whole heart carries,
    And ne'er will bear it back again.

  For if its silent passion grieve you,
    My heart would then too heavy grow;--
  And it can never, never leave you,
    If joy of yours must with it go!
