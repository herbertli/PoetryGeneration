    "The father tired at last and came no more,
      But in his settled anger bade prepare
    The marriage feast with all luxurious store,
      With pomps, and shows and splendors rich and rare;
    And so in toil another fortnight wore,
      Nor knew she aught what things were in the air,
    Till came the old lord's message brief and coarse:
    Within three days she should be wed by force.
