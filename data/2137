    For Nino knows the captain of a ship,
      The friend of many journeys, who may be
    This very morn will let his cables slip
      For the warm coast of sunny Sicily.
    There in Palermo, at the harbour's lip,
      A brother lives, of tried fidelity:
    So to the quays by hidden ways they wend
    In the pale morn, nor do they miss their friend.
