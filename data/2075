    The trees rustle; the wind blows
        Merrily out of the town;
    The shadows creep, the sun goes
        Steadily over and down.

    In a brown gloom the moats gleam;
      Slender the sweet wife stands;
    Her lips are red; her eyes dream;
      Kisses are warm on her hands.

    The child moans; the hours slip
      Bitterly over her head:
    In a gray dusk, the tears drip;
      Mother is up there dead.

    The hermit hears the strange bright
      Murmur of life at play;
    In the waste day and the waste night
      Times to rebel and to pray.

    The laborer toils in gray wise,
      Godlike and patient and calm;
    The beggar moans; his bleared eyes
      Measure the dust in his palm.

    The wise man marks the flow and ebb
      Hidden and held aloof:
    In his deep mind is laid the web,
      Shuttles are driving the woof.
