  Eternal Hope! when yonder spheres sublime
  Pealed their first notes to sound the march of Time,
  Thy joyous youth began,--but not to fade.
  When all the sister planets have decayed;
  When wrapt in fire the realms of ether glow,
  And Heaven's last thunder shakes the world below;
  Thou, undismayed, shalt o'er the ruins smile,
  And light thy torch at Nature's funeral pile.

THOMAS CAMPBELL.
