    If any man, with sleepless care oppressed,
    On many a night had risen, and addressed
    His hand to make him out of joy and moan
    An image of sweet sleep in carven stone,
    Light touch by touch, in weary moments planned,
    He would have wrought her with a patient hand,
    Not like her brother death, with massive limb
    And dreamless brow, unstartled, changeless, dim,
    But very fair, though fitful and afraid,
    More sweet and slight than any mortal maid.
    Her hair he would have carved a mantle smooth
    Down to her tender feet to wrap and soothe
    All fevers in, yet barb?here and there
    With many a hidden sting of restless care;
    Her brow most quiet, thick with opiate rest,
    Yet watchfully lined, as if some hovering guest
    Of noiseless doubt were there; so too her eyes
    His light hand would have carved in cunning wise
    Broad with all languor of the drowsy South,
    Most beautiful, but held askance; her mouth
    More soft and round than any rose half-spread,
    Yet ever twisted with some nervous dread.
    He would have made her with one marble foot,
    Frail as a snow-white feather, forward put,
    Bearing sweet medicine for all distress,
    Smooth languor and unstrung forgetfulness;
    The other held a little back for dread;
    One slender moonpale hand held forth to shed
    Soft slumber dripping from its pearly tip
    Into wide eyes; the other on her lip.
    So in the watches of his sleepless care
    The cunning artist would have wrought her fair;
    Shy goddess, at keen seeking most afraid
    Yet often coming, when we least have prayed.
