    Nor evermore she came. Full many days
      He sought her at their trysts, devised deep schemes
    To lure her back, and fell on subtle ways
      To win some word of her; but all his dreams
    Vanished like smoke, and then in sore amaze
      From town to town, as one that craz?seems,
    He wandered, following in unhappy quest
    Uncertain clues that ended like the rest.
