  Wild days that woke to glory or despair,
    And smote the coward soul with sudden shame,
  But unto those whose hearts were bold to dare
    All things for honor brought eternal fame:--
        Lost days, undying days!
        With undiminished rays
        Here now on us look down,
        Illumining our crown
  Of leaves memorial, wet with tender dew
    For those who nobly died
  In fierce self-sacrifice of service true,
    Rapt in pure fire of life-disdaining pride;
  Men of this soil, who stood
    Firm for their country's good,
  From night to night, from sun to sun,
    Till o'er the living and the slain
  A woful dawn that streamed with rain
    Wept for their victory dearly won.
