  With heart pain and with quiver of the lip,
      I bid my boy "good bye," with words of cheer.
      I hug him to my heart to hide a tear,
  And hold him close so long, that no tongue-slip
  Could more betray my bodings for his ship,
      Or troop, when landed. It is when I hear
      My daughters' voices, that I shame off fear
  And take my boy's both hands with firmest grip.

  Go, son, and, though with thy young life 'tis blown,
      Blare thou the Bugle, rousing man to sweep
      The monsters back to Hell's profoundest deep,
  Where, mocking Spring and Sun-rise, they have grown
  On longings for the sea, the world must weep
      When, from its heart, the hope of Peace has flown.
