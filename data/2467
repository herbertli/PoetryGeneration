  Veteran memories rally to muster
    Here at the call of the old battle days:
  Cavalry clatter and cannon's hoarse bluster:
    All the wild whirl of the fight's broken maze:
  Clangor of bugle and flashing of sabre,
    Smoke-stifled flags and the howl of the shell,
  With earth for a rest place and death for a neighbor,
    And dreams of a charge and the deep rebel yell.
  Stern was our task in the field where the reaping
    Spared the ripe harvest, but laid our men low:
  Grim was the sorrow that held us from weeping:
     Awful the rush of the strife's ebb and flow.
  Swift came the silence--our enemy hiding
    Sudden retreat in the cloud-muffled night:
  Swift as a hawk-pounce our hill-and-dale riding;
    Hundreds on hundreds we caught in their flight!
  Hard and incessant the danger and trial,
    Laid on our squadrons, that gladly bore all,
  Scorning to meet with delay or denial
    The summons that rang in the battle-days' call!
