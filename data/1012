THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND.


  When mighty roast beef was the Englishman's food,
  It ennobled our hearts, and enriched our blood;
  Our soldiers were brave, and our courtiers were good.
        _O, the Roast Beef of old England,
        And O, the old English Roast Beef_!

  But since we have learned from effeminate France
  To eat their ragouts, as well as to dance,
  We are fed up with nothing but vain complaisance.
        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.

HENRY FIELDING.
