  All hail to those who, through the stormy night,
      Make Liberty the light on Erin's coast;
      Who, ceaseless, send up sparks; who hold their post
  On each and every ledge of Human Right,
  Forming a beacon blaze from base to height
      Where Erin's hope may steer and land its host.
      Look, Human Nature! Where else canst thou boast
  To the eternal stars, so grand a sight?

  Look! How men there ennoble human kind
      By making Liberty the light to Peace!
      All other lights are false. Oh! who but sees
  In the unconquerable Celtic mind
  That, even in Time, there are Eternities--
      Love, true to Right, and Will no wrong can bind!
