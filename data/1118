A DANISH BARROW

ON THE EAST DEVON COAST.


  Lie still, old Dane, below thy heap!
    A sturdy-back and sturdy-limb,
    Whoe'er he was, I warrant him
  Upon whose mound the single sheep
    Browses and tinkles in the sun,
    Within the narrow vale alone.

  Lie still, old Dane! This restful scene
    Suits well thy centuries of sleep:
    The soft brown roots above thee creep,
  The lotus flaunts his ruddy sheen,
    And,--vain memento of the spot,--The
    turquoise-eyed forget-me-not.

  Lie still! Thy mother-land herself
    Would know thee not again: no more
    The Raven from the northern shore
  Hails the bold crew to push for pelf,
    Through fire and blood and slaughtered kings
    'Neath the black terror of his wings.

  And thou,--thy very name is lost!
    The peasant only knows that here
    Bold Alfred scooped thy flinty bier,
  And prayed a foeman's prayer, and tost
    His auburn head, and said, "One more
    Of England's foes guards England's shore,"

  And turned and passed to other feats,
    And left thee in thine iron robe,
    To circle with the circling globe,
  While Time's corrosive dewdrop eats
    The giant warrior to a crust
    Of earth in earth, and rust in rust.

  So lie: and let the children play
    And sit like flowers upon thy grave
    And crown with flowers,--that hardly have
  A briefer blooming-tide than they;--
    By hurrying years urged on to rest,
    As thou within the Mother's breast.

FRANCIS TURNER PALGRAVE.
