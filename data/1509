  In Wilson we beheld and proudly hailed
      The World's Deliverer. In him, we saw
      A luminous being rise from earth and draw
  All lands above the clouds. We were regaled
  With justice cascades flow, long ice impaled
      Upon high mountains. Was not Nature's thaw
      From his heart heat for truth, Eternal Law?
  His was the heat of all the stars, he scaled.

  Though his ascension was like Christ's, sublime
      With lift of continents and every isle,
      He, less than Christ, succumbed to Demon Guile.
  Oh, God, that he should drop his mountain climb
  Below sea-level, and let earth the while,
      Fall back and settle in Primeval Slime!
