MY GOD, I LOVE THEE.


  My God, I love thee! not because
    I hope for heaven thereby;
  Nor because those who love thee not
    Must burn eternally.

  Thou, O my Jesus, thou didst me
    Upon the cross embrace!
  For me didst bear the nails and spear,
    And manifold disgrace,

  And griefs and torments numberless,
    And sweat of agony,
  Yea, death itself,--and all for one
    That was thine enemy.

  Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ,
    Should I not love thee well?
  Not for the hope of winning heaven,
    Nor of escaping hell;

  Not with the hope of gaining aught,
    Not seeking a reward;
  But as thyself hast loved me,
    O everlasting Lord!

  E'en so I love thee, and will love,
    And in thy praise will sing,--
  Solely because thou art my God,
    And my eternal King.

From the Latin of ST. FRANCIS XAVIER.
