    And when, day passed and over heaven's height,
      Thin with the many stars and cool with dew,
      The fingers of the deep hours slowly drew
    The wonder of the ever-healing night,
    No grief or loneliness or wrapt delight
      Or weight of silence ever brought to you
      Slumber or rest; only your voices grew
    More high and solemn; slowly with hushed flight

    Ye saw the echoing hours go by, long-drawn,
      Nor ever stirred, watching with fathomless eyes,
      And with your countless clear antiphonies
    Filling the earth and heaven, even till dawn,
      Last-risen, found you with its first pale gleam,
      Still with soft throats unaltered in your dream.
