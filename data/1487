  Of all the fulminates, gold is the worst,
      Which England, aeroplaning, now, lets drop
      By day and night, in bank, press, church and shop,
  Timed to the minute that it is to burst.
  List to Demosthenes, if not to Hearst,
      Sublime Republic! Lest thy great heart stop,
      Shocked by the blast of Freedom's every prop,
  And bats and owls in dwellings, Human's erst.

  "Watch Macedon. She drops her gold, in creeping
      Beneath free Athens' sky-ascending stair.
      Watch her with glance of sword. Oh, watch, for where
  She sows her gold, she comes with scythes for reaping!
  Is Athens in ascent with sun-light flare,
      To come down ashes, not worth history's keeping?"
