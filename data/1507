  Who is to rise and hurl God's flame world-wide,
      As Lincoln hurled it, setting free a race
      From Sphinx-shaped wrong--a beast with human face?
  That shattered, how our land rose glorified
  And, from the stars last laggard, soared, their guide!
      Oh, who can take Promethean Lincoln's place,
      To bring light where-so-ever he can trace
  A Human, with his rights to soul denied?

  He must be one, not only to illume
      All ages, and not leave one region dim,
      But at no height, allow his senses swim,
  Or let mirages lure him with false bloom.
  Lo! Here one comes with all the virtues prim
      To hurl God's fire and end all human gloom.
