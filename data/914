THE MARTYRS' HYMN.


  Flung to the heedless winds,
    Or on the waters cast,
  The martyrs' ashes, watched,
    Shall gathered be at last;
  And from that scattered dust,
    Around us and abroad,
  Shall spring a plenteous seed
    Of witnesses for God.

  The Father hath received
    Their latest living breath;
  And vain is Satan's boast
    Of victory in their death;
  Still, still, though dead, they speak,
    And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim
  To many a wakening land
    The one availing name.

From the German of MARTIN LUTHER.
