 How deep the April night is in its noon,
 The hopeful, solemn, many-murmured night!
 The earth lies hushed with expectation; bright
 Above the world's dark border burns the moon,
 Yellow and large; from forest floorways, strewn
 With flowers, and fields that tingle with new birth,
 The moist smell of the unimprisoned earth
 Comes up, a sigh, a haunting promise. Soon,
 Ah, soon, the teeming triumph! At my feet
 The river with its stately sweep and wheel
 Moves on slow-motioned, luminous, grey like steel.
 From fields far off whose watery hollows gleam,
 Aye with blown throats that make the long hours sweet,
 The sleepless toads are murmuring in their dream.
