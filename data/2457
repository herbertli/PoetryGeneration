    What is the sound we hear?
  Never the fall of a tear;
  For grief repressed
  In every breast
  More honors the man we revere.
  Rising from East and West,
  There echoes afar or near--
  From the cool, sad North and the burning South--
  A sound long since grown dear,
  When brave ranks faced the cannon's mouth
  And died for a faith austere:
  The tread of marching men,
  A steady tramp of feet
  That never flinched nor faltered when
  The drums of duty beat.
  With sable hats whose shade
  Falls from the cord of gold
  On every time-worn face;
  With tattered flags, in black enrolled,
  Beneath whose folds they warred of old;
  Forward, firmly arrayed,
  With a sombre, martial grace;
  So the Grand Army moves
  Commanded by the dead,
  Following him whose name it loves,
  Whose voice in life its footsteps led.
