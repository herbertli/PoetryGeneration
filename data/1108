CATILINE TO THE ROMAN ARMY.

FROM "CATILINE," ACT V. SC. 2.


  Sound all to arms!     (_A flourish of trumpets._)
  Call in the captains,--     (_To an officer_)
                         I would speak with them!

            (_The officer goes._)

  Now, Hope! away,--and welcome gallant Death!
  Welcome the clanging shield, the trumpet's yell,--
  Welcome the fever of the mounting blood,
  That makes wounds light, and battle's crimson toil
  Seem but a sport,--and welcome the cold bed,
  Where soldiers with their upturned faces lie,--
  And welcome wolf's and vulture's hungry throats,
  That make their sepulchres! We fight to-night.

          (_The soldiery enter._)

  Centurions! all is ruined! I disdain
  To hide the truth from you. The die is thrown!
  And now, let each that wishes for long life
  Put up his sword, and kneel for peace to Rome.
  Ye all are free to go. What! no man stirs!
  Not one! a soldier's spirit in you all?
  Give me your hands! (This moisture in my eyes
  Is womanish,--'twill pass.) My noble hearts!
  Well have you chosen to die! For, in my mind,
  The grave is better than o'erburdened life;
  Better the quick release of glorious wounds,
  Than the eternal taunts of galling tongues;
  Better the spear-head quivering in the heart,
  Than daily struggle against fortune's curse;
  Better, in manhood's muscle and high blood,
  To leap the gulf, than totter to its edge
  In poverty, dull pain, and base decay.
  Once more, I say,--are ye resolved?

        (_The soldiers shout_, "All! All!")

  Then, each man to his tent, and take the arms
  That he would love to die in,--for, _this hour_,
  We storm the Consul's camp. A last farewell!

           (_He takes their hands._)

  When next we meet,--we'll have no time to look,
  How parting clouds a soldier's countenance.
  Few as we are, we'll rouse them with a peal
  That shall shake Rome!
  Now to your cohorts' heads;--the word's--Revenge!

GEORGE CROLY.
