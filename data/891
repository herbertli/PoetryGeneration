  When once thy foot enters the church, be bare.
  God is more there than thou; for thou art there
  Only by his permission. Then beware,
  And make thyself all reverence and fear.
    Kneeling ne'er spoiled silk stockings; quit thy state;
    All equal are within the church's gate.

  Resort to sermons, but to prayers most:
  Praying's the end of preaching. O, be drest!
  Stay not for th' other pin: why thou hast lost
  A joy for it worth worlds. Thus hell doth jest
    Away thy blessings, and extremely flout thee,
    Thy clothes being fast, but thy soul loose about thee.

  Judge not the preacher; for he is thy judge:
  If thou mislike him, thou conceiv'st him not.
  God calleth preaching folly. Do not grudge
  To pick out treasures from an earthen pot.
    The worst speak something good: if _all_ want sense,
    God takes a text, and preacheth Pa-ti-ence.

GEORGE HERBERT.
