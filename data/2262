 Didst thou not tease and fret me to and fro,
 Sweet spirit of this summer-circled field,
 With that quiet voice of thine that would not yield
 Its meaning, though I mused and sought it so?
 But now I am content to let it go,
 To lie at length and watch the swallows pass,
 As blithe and restful as this quiet grass,
 Content only to listen and to know
 That years shall turn, and summers yet shall shine,
 And I shall lie beneath these swaying trees,
 Still listening thus; haply at last to seize,
 And render in some happier verse divine
 That friendly, homely, haunting speech of thine,
 That perfect utterance of content and ease.
