  God loves the stars; else why star-shape the dew
      For the unbreathing, shy, heart-hiding rose?
      And when earth darkens, and the North wind blows,
  Why into stars, flake every cloud's black brew?
  What fitter forms for longings high and true,
      Man's hopes, ideals, than bright orbs like those
      Asbine from Nature's dawn to Nature's close,
  In clusters, prisming every dazzling hue?

  Nor is the Sun with harvests in its heat,
      And that, sky-hidden, makes the moon at night,
      An earth-ward cascade for its leaps of light,
  More real, or a world force more complete,
  Than Faith and Hope, that brake through clouds with sight
      Of evil's foil and ultimate defeat.
