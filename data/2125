    So ends the stranger: surely no man's tongue
      Was e'er so soft, or half so sweet, as his.
    Oft as he listened, Nino's heart had sprung
      With sudden start as from a spectre's kiss;
    For deep in many a word he deemed had rung
      The liquid fall of some loved emphasis;
    And so it pierced his sorrow to the core,
    The ghost of tones that he should hear no more.
